# Displacement Check

A descriptive operator for detecting cost displacement.

## Input

- System boundary
- Apparent local fix
- Time horizon

## Output

Location and magnitude of displaced erasure cost.

## Procedure

1. Identify the apparent local resolution
2. Trace where erasure work relocated
3. Identify who/what is now carrying the cost
4. Report displacement path and new holder

## Failure modes

- Missing displacement: cost relocated beyond observation boundary
- Attribution error: incorrect identification of cost holder

## Non-claims

This does not evaluate whether displacement is good or bad.
This does not recommend actions to prevent displacement.
