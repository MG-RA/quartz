# Irreversibility

> [!note]
> Scope: Structural clarification only. This is not a theory, diagnostic, projection, or advice.

## Invariant statement

Irreversibility is a **structural property**: within a declared [[transformation-space]], some differences persist and their removal has non-local, non-symmetric cost.

## Minimal decomposition

- [[transformation-space]] declares what counts as “the same thing.”
- [[persistent-difference]] names what remains re-identifiable under that scope.
- [[erasure-cost]] is the operational burden required to eliminate a persistent difference.
- [[erasure-asymmetry]] names the non-symmetry between producing and erasing differences.

## Structural consequences (non-normative)

- Local rollback claims can be insufficient when persistence has propagated ([[propagation]]).
- Removal work routes somewhere ([[displacement]] / [[absorption]]), whether tracked or not.
- Untracked persistence is consistent with [[accounting-failure]] and rising [[constraint-load]].
- Under accumulation, option sets can shrink discontinuously ([[collapse-surface]]).

## What this prevents

- “Undo later” treated as a default without specifying where erasure work lands
- Explanations that treat persistence as a moral property instead of a bookkeeping property
- Claims of reversibility without a declared transformation space
- Hidden displacement via “cleanup will happen” language

## What this does NOT claim

- No claim that all change is irreversible
- No claim that irreversibility is always harmful or always beneficial
- No claim that diagnosis implies a prescription or ranking
- No claim that irreversibility is a metaphysical theory of time
