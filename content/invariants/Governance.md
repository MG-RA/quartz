# Governance

> **Status:** Structural invariant  
> **Scope:** Vault, tools, and author behavior  
> **Non-claim:** This is not a moral rule or political principle. It specifies the minimal condition for a system to remain self-correcting under scale.

---

## Statement

**No actor may be exempt from the constraints they impose.**

This includes:

- authors
- tools
- processes
- interpretive authorities

---

## Purpose

This invariant exists to prevent:

- authority leakage
- silent exception creation
- drift justified by intent or expertise
- collapse of corrigibility

It ensures that enforcement does not replace explanation, and that clarity does not turn into obligation.

---

## Implications

- Lint rules apply to all notes, including those written by the author.
- Diagnostics do not convert into prescriptions by status or clarity.
- Tools surface violations instead of silently correcting them.
- No role grants interpretive immunity.
- Governance responsibility operates at the structural/governance agency layer (see [[Attribution]]).

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a claim that all actors are equal
- Not a denial of expertise
- Not a prohibition on judgment or action
- Not a guarantee against misuse

It constrains **structure**, not behavior.

---

## Failure Mode if Violated

If any actor becomes exempt:

- governance collapses into authority
- errors become invisible
- correction requires conflict rather than inspection

At that point, the system can no longer diagnose itself.

---

## Summary

> **Governance exists to prevent exemption, not to direct outcomes.**
