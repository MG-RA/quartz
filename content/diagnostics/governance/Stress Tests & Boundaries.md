# Governance - Stress Tests & Boundaries

> [!warning]
> Misuse risk: Turning governance diagnosis into power struggles or reflexivity as obstruction.

## Where the governance lens does not help

- The system is small enough that all constraint surfaces are trivially visible to all participants.
- All actors genuinely share the same constraint surfaces with no asymmetry (rare in practice).
- The system has no enforcement mechanisms at all (pure advisory systems where governance analysis is inapplicable).
- Governance analysis is being used to obstruct legitimate authority rather than to ensure inspectability.

## Apparent counterexamples (brief)

- Emergency overrides: temporary exemptions that bypass normal constraints. Governance analysis applies — the question is whether the exemption is declared, scoped, time-limited, and auditable, not whether it exists.
- Expertise: domain experts may legitimately interpret constraints differently. Governance analysis applies — the question is whether those interpretations are inspectable, not whether expertise is recognized.
- Bootstrapping: a new system cannot yet enforce its own governance. Governance analysis applies — the question is whether the bootstrap path toward self-diagnosability is declared.

## Misuse patterns

- Using governance analysis to dismantle authority rather than to ensure inspectability.
- Treating all asymmetry as exemption (some asymmetries are declared and appropriate).
- Weaponizing reflexivity: demanding that every governance act justify itself recursively as a form of obstruction.
- Over-diagnosis: seeing exemptions everywhere as a way to avoid engaging with legitimate constraints.
- Confusing governance with democracy: governance invariants constrain inspectability, not political structure.
