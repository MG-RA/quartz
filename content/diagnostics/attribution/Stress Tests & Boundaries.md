# Attribution - Stress Tests & Boundaries

> [!warning]
> Misuse risk: Turning attribution diagnosis into blame assignment or moral verdicts.

## Where the attribution lens does not help

- All actors share the same control surface and agency layer (no asymmetry to diagnose).
- Effects are genuinely accidental with no structured control surface (pure stochastic outcomes).
- The system is so simple that control, layer, and responsibility are trivially obvious.
- Attribution is being used to determine punishment rather than to diagnose structural gaps.

## Apparent counterexamples (brief)

- Collective action: responsibility appears diffuse, but governance-layer control surfaces often exist (rule-makers, incentive designers). Attribution analysis still applies at the structural layer.
- Emergent effects: no single role controlled the outcome, but constraint surfaces shaped the option landscape. Attribution applies to the governance layer, not the individual layer.
- Automation: "the algorithm did it" — but control surfaces for algorithm design, deployment, and monitoring exist. Attribution applies to those surfaces.

## Misuse patterns

- Using attribution analysis to assign blame rather than to diagnose structural gaps.
- Treating "correctly attributed" as "deserves punishment" (attribution is structural, not moral).
- Inflating governance attribution into conspiracy (governance responsibility is about constraint surfaces, not intent).
- Using attribution to exempt individuals from all responsibility by routing everything to "the system."
- Diagnosis-to-prescription drift: attribution output treated as an action mandate.
