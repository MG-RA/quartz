# Explanatory Circuits
**Non-claim**: This note names _patterns of circulation_ observed in the concept graph. It does not introduce new ontology or primitives.

## What is a circuit?

In this framework, a **circuit** is a recurrent path through which explanations _flow_.

- Nodes are not facts; they are **interfaces**.
    
- Edges are not causes; they are **routes of explanation**.
    
- A circuit exists when explanation repeatedly traverses a similar path under different questions.
    

Circuits are detected empirically (community detection), not declared analytically.

---

## What is the “electricity”?

The quantity that flows through circuits is **explanatory load**.

Depending on context, this load appears as:

- unresolved cost
    
- unaccounted difference
    
- pressure to explain failure
    
- demand for attribution
    
- need to justify irreversibility
    

This load is not numeric. It is **routing pressure**: when an explanation cannot proceed without passing through a concept.

---

## What acts like a transistor?

A **transistor-like concept** has three properties:

1. **Gating**: it allows or blocks explanatory paths
    
2. **Amplification**: small changes upstream cause large downstream effects
    
3. **Directionality**: explanation flows preferentially one way
    

Examples (by role, not category):

- `admissibility` gates which transitions are even discussable
    
- `erasure-cost` amplifies small differences into large consequences
    
- `collapse-surface` forces termination of explanation
    

These are _not_ new types. They are **roles under load**.

## Identified explanatory circuits

### 1. Cost Routing Loop

**Function**: move irreducible burden after intervention attempts

Typical path:

```
mechanism → residual → constraint-load → feasible-set → (back to mechanism)
```

This loop answers: _where does the cost go now?_

---

### 2. Persistence Boundary Field

**Function**: define what cannot be undone

Typical cluster:

```
persistence ↔ difference ↔ erasure-cost ↔ saturation / brittleness
```

This field answers: _what remains no matter what we do?_

---

### 3. Projection–Interpretation Bridge

**Function**: map abstract constraints into domains without mutation

Typical span:

```
primitive → transformation-space → admissibility → projection
```

This bridge answers: _how does this vocabulary apply here?_

---

## Why this matters diagnostically

- Circuits reveal **how explanations actually move**, not how they are categorized.
    
- High load on a circuit indicates:
    
    - hidden accumulation
        
    - misattribution risk
        
    - likely failure of naive fixes
        
- Changes to a node inside a circuit propagate non-locally.

## What this is not

- Not a theory of cognition
    
- Not a claim about physical systems
    
- Not a metaphor for electronics
    

The circuit language is a **reading aid** for graph structure.

---

## Open questions (explicitly left open)

- Are there stable sub-circuits that recur across domains?
    
- Do new circuits appear as the vault grows, or only densify?
    
- Can circuit load be proxied operationally without metrification?
    

These questions are admissible but unanswered.
