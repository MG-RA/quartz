# Concept Drift Exposure Map

Tags: #diagnostic #meta

This document records drift classification for high-centrality concepts across the vault. Generated by structural audit.

> [!info]
> Orientation: Drift classification only; canonical definitions live in `/concepts`.

**Classification key:**
- **preserved**: usage matches canonical definition
- **softened**: usage compatible but loses precision or boundary conditions
- **overloaded**: usage extends beyond canonical scope
- **violated**: usage contradicts canonical definition or "What this is NOT"

---

## 1. erasure-cost

**Canonical definition** ([erasure-cost.md](../concepts/erasure-cost.md)):
> The set of resources required to remove a persistent difference, or to reduce it such that it no longer constrains future options.

**What this is NOT:**
- Not punishment or penalty (structural, not normative)
- Not effort (effort can be expended without effect)
- Not price (prices are assigned; erasure cost exists whether tracked or not)
- Not entropy
- Not delay

### Paper Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| §3.1 (line 47) | "A difference is persistent if its removal requires exporting erasure cost beyond the local frame" | **preserved** |
| §3.2 (line 56) | "Undoing a persistent difference requires routing cost elsewhere" | **preserved** |
| §3.3 (line 63) | "Erasure costs are displaced to others or the future" | **preserved** |
| §4.2 (line 82) | "What would removal actually require?" | **preserved** |

### MOC Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 90 | "The price of removal; operational test for persistence" | **softened** — uses "price" which canonical definition explicitly excludes. However, context shows metaphorical use. Near-violation. |
| Line 136 | "What would removal actually require?" | **preserved** |
| Line 175 | "Marginal erasure cost begins to dominate marginal action capacity" | **preserved** |
| Line 190 | "Erasure cost is the operational test for persistence" | **preserved** |

### Domain Usage

| Domain | Location | Usage | Classification |
|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Software Supply Chains | Line 25 | "erasure-cost lands on dependency discovery, compatibility testing, rebuilds, incident response, and coordinating upgrades" | **preserved** |
| Software Supply Chains | Line 30 | "erasure-cost lands on retooling builds, recreating provenance" | **preserved** |
| AI Systems | Line 25 | "erasure-cost lands on data discovery, rights/compliance work, rebuild/retrain cycles" | **preserved** |
| AI Systems | Line 30 | "erasure requires locating copies, derivatives, and integrations" | **preserved** |
| Financial Infrastructure | Line 25 | "erasure-cost lands on re-plumbing contracts, netting arrangements" | **preserved** |
| Digital Platforms | Line 25 | "erasure-cost lands on many systems (storage, backups, derived models)" | **preserved** |
| Digital Platforms | Lines 30-31, 35-36 | "Erasure-cost lands on..." and "Erasure asymmetry:" | **softened** — drops wikilink formatting, lowercase, but semantically correct |
| Human History | Line 53 | "Where would erasure-cost land if someone tried to reverse it?" | **preserved** |

**Summary: erasure-cost**
- Paper: 4/4 preserved
- MOC: 3/4 preserved, 1/4 softened (metaphorical "price")
- Domains: 7/8 preserved, 1/8 softened (formatting only)
- **Overall: preserved with one near-violation in MOC (line 90)**

## 2. persistent-difference

**Canonical definition** ([persistent-difference.md](../concepts/persistent-difference.md)):
> A pattern that remains re-identifiable across a specified transformation space. Its defining feature is not duration but resistance to elimination: removing the difference requires non-trivial erasure effort that cannot be resolved locally or costlessly.

**What this is NOT:**
- Not permanence (always relative to transformation space)
- Not significance (may persist without mattering)
- Not harm (structural, not evaluative)
- Not memory (substrate-agnostic)
- Not irreversibility itself (persistence is condition; irreversibility describes cost asymmetry)

### Paper Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 4 | "Systems that produce persistent differences without tracking mechanisms" | **preserved** |
| Line 10 | "systems that produce persistent differences while operating as if those effects were reversible" | **preserved** |
| Line 25 | "Persistent differences accumulate even as corrections are applied" | **preserved** |
| Line 45-46 | "Persistence is defined relative to a transformation-space" | **preserved** |
| Line 62 | "Persistent effects accumulate" | **softened** — uses "effects" interchangeably with "differences" |
| Line 112 | "persistent effects accumulate faster than rollback capacity" | **softened** — same pattern |
| Line 122 | "No account of accumulated persistent-difference" | **preserved** |

### MOC Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 5 | "What irreversible differences is this system producing" | **softened** — conflates "persistent" with "irreversible" which canonical definition explicitly distinguishes |
| Line 62 | "persistent-difference" in diagram | **preserved** |
| Line 82 | "The primitive: a pattern whose removal requires exporting cost" | **preserved** |
| Line 174 | "Irreversible effects accumulate faster than rollback capacity" | **softened** — same conflation as line 5 |
| Line 189 | "Persistence is always relative to a transformation space" | **preserved** |

### Domain Usage

| Domain | Location | Usage | Classification |
|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Software Supply Chains | Lines 24, 29, 34, etc. | "Persistence test: remains re-identifiable across..." | **preserved** |
| AI Systems | Lines 24, 29, 34, etc. | "Persistence test: re-identifiable across..." | **preserved** |
| Financial Infrastructure | Lines 24, 29, 34, etc. | "Persistence test: remains re-identifiable..." | **preserved** |
| Digital Platforms | Lines 24, 29, 34, etc. | "Persistence test: remains re-identifiable..." | **preserved** |
| Human History | Line 7 | "producing persistent-difference under a specified transformation-space" | **preserved** |
| Human History | Line 48 | "test each against persistent-difference and transformation-space" | **preserved** |

**Summary: persistent-difference**
- Paper: 5/7 preserved, 2/7 softened ("effects" for "differences")
- MOC: 3/5 preserved, 2/5 softened (conflation with "irreversible")
- Domains: 6/6 preserved
- **Overall: preserved, but MOC shows slippage between "persistent" and "irreversible"**

## 3. erasure-asymmetry

**Canonical definition** ([erasure-asymmetry.md](../concepts/erasure-asymmetry.md)):
> The observed imbalance between the ease of producing a persistent difference and the cost of undoing it. Creating an effect often requires limited, localized action, while undoing that effect requires broader effort, coordination, or expenditure.

**What this is NOT:**
- Not injustice (structural, not moral)
- Not inefficiency (may be unavoidable)
- Not thermodynamic irreversibility specifically
- Not a bug (some asymmetries are features)

### Paper Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 35 | "erasure-asymmetry between causing and undoing" | **preserved** |
| Line 53-54 | "Erasure asymmetry describes the structural imbalance whereby production is local and inexpensive, while removal is distributed and costly" | **preserved** |

### MOC Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 13 | "asymmetry compounds" | **preserved** |
| Line 52 | "erasure-asymmetry" in diagram | **preserved** |
| Line 91 | "Production cheap/local; removal expensive/distributed" | **preserved** |
| Line 191 | "Asymmetry between production and removal is the norm, not exception" | **preserved** |

### Domain Usage

| Domain | Location | Usage | Classification |
|--------|----------|-------|----------------|
| Software Supply Chains | Line 26 | "adding a dependency is often local; removing/replacing it requires ecosystem-wide coordination" | **preserved** |
| Software Supply Chains | Lines 31, 36, 41, 46, 51 | All follow "creation is easy; removal is hard" pattern | **preserved** |
| AI Systems | Line 26 | "ingesting data is easy; proving deletion of influence across a deployed ecosystem is non-local" | **preserved** |
| AI Systems | Lines 31, 36, 41, 46 | All follow pattern | **preserved** |
| Financial Infrastructure | Line 26 | "moving flows into a CCP can be incremental; reversing it requires coordinated re-architecture" | **preserved** |
| Financial Infrastructure | Line 36 | "requiring collateral can be mandated or normed quickly; undoing it must recreate trust" | **preserved** |
| Digital Platforms | Lines 26, 31, 36, 41 | All follow pattern | **preserved** |

**Summary: erasure-asymmetry**
- Paper: 2/2 preserved
- MOC: 4/4 preserved
- Domains: All preserved
- **Overall: fully preserved across vault**

## 4. admissibility

**Canonical definition** ([admissibility.md](../concepts/admissibility.md)):
> A structural selector that determines whether a transition, explanation, or action is allowed once constraints are respected. It answers the question: Given the current constraint load, is this path still available?

**What this is NOT:**
- Not possibility (possibility ignores constraints; admissibility respects them)
- Not desirability (desirability ranks by value; admissibility is structural)
- Not optimality (optimality seeks the best; admissibility identifies the available)
- Not legality (legality is rule-based; admissibility is constraint-based)
- Not feasibility (feasibility concerns capacity; admissibility concerns structural allowance)

### Paper Usage

| Location | Usage | Classification |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| Not directly used in paper body | — | — |
| Line 112 (indirect) | "persistent effects accumulate faster than rollback capacity" — describes admissibility shrinking without using term | **preserved** (implicit) |

### MOC Usage

|----------|-------|----------------|
| Line 100 | "Accumulated incompatibilities; narrowed configuration space" (describing constraint-load, which feeds admissibility) | **preserved** |
| Line 110 | "Threshold where options eliminate" (describing collapse-surface as admissibility boundary) | **preserved** |

### Domain Usage

| Human History | Line 14 | "shifts in what is admissible (what transitions remain structurally available)" | **preserved** |
| Human History | Line 62 | "Which transitions stop being admissible?" | **preserved** |

**Summary: admissibility**

- MOC: 2/2 preserved
- Domains: 10/10 preserved
- **Overall: fully preserved across vault**

## Findings Requiring Attention

### 1. MOC line 90: "price of removal"

The canonical definition explicitly states erasure-cost is "Not price (prices are assigned; erasure cost exists whether tracked or not)."

**Location:** [Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md:90](../papers/Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md#L90)
**Current text:** "The price of removal; operational test for persistence"
**Issue:** Metaphorical use of "price" risks reification (Failure Mode #1)
**Classification:** softened / near-violation

### 2. MOC conflates "persistent" with "irreversible"

The canonical definition of persistent-difference explicitly states: "Not irreversibility itself (persistence is a condition; irreversibility describes cost asymmetry over transitions)."

**Locations:**
- [Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md:5](../papers/Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md#L5): "What irreversible differences is this system producing"
- [Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md:174](../papers/Irreversibility-Accounting-MOC.md#L174): "Irreversible effects accumulate"

**Issue:** Conflation loses the distinction that persistence is substrate-level, irreversibility is the composed property (persistence + asymmetry)
**Classification:** softened

### 3. Paper uses "effects" for "differences"

**Locations:**
- [Irreversibility Accounting (Paper).md:62](../papers/Irreversibility%20Accounting%20(Paper).md#L62): "Persistent effects accumulate"
- [Irreversibility Accounting (Paper).md:112](../papers/Irreversibility%20Accounting%20(Paper).md#L112): "persistent effects accumulate"

**Issue:** "Effects" is less precise than "differences" — effects implies causal action, differences is structural
**Classification:** softened (acceptable but imprecise)

## Maintenance Note

This document was generated as part of structural audit. Per [Decomposition Map §11](../meta/Decomposition%20Map.md), maintenance = any change that alters reference topology, layer designation, or invariant phrasing.

If concept definitions change, this drift map should be re-run.
