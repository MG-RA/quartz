# Irreversibility Lens - Diagnostic Checklist

> [!note]
> Non-claim: Output is descriptive; it does not rank outcomes or recommend actions.

## Core question

What persistent differences is this system producing, and who is carrying them?

## Supporting checks

### Transformation-space check

- Declare the transformation space: what changes count as "the same thing" for this diagnosis.
- List allowed transformations (what re-identification survives).

### Erasure-cost check

- For each candidate persistent difference: what would removal actually require?
- Where does the work land (time, coordination, money, attention, compute)?

### Displacement check

- If something looks locally fixed: where did the erasure cost relocate?
- Who/what is paying, and on what time horizon?

### Persistence gradient

- For whom is this reversible vs irreversible?
- Which actors can reverse locally, and which cannot?

### Constraint-load check

- What incompatibilities accumulate as these differences persist?
- Which transitions become less admissible as constraints stack?

### Collapse-surface check

- Write 1-3 conditional boundaries:
  - IF (pattern continues), THEN (option becomes unavailable).
