# Irreversibility Lens (Diagnostics)

> [!info]
> Orientation: This lens references concept notes; it does not define or own them.

Scope: irreversibility-first diagnosis (persistence + erasure-cost asymmetry) for systems where effects do not unwind locally at comparable cost.

## Non-claims

- Not ethics
- Not policy
- Not prediction
- Not prescriptions

## How to use

- Run [[Diagnostic Checklist]] on a bounded system.
- Record outputs in a template note.
- Stop after the output block is filled.

## Hygiene rules

- Keep notes short (bullets).
- Use existing concept vocabulary; avoid inventing new primitives inside diagnostic notes.
- Examples link to core concepts/diagnostics; core concepts/diagnostics do not depend on examples.
