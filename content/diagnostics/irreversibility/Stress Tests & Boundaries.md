# Irreversibility Lens - Stress Tests & Boundaries

> Misuse risk: Turning diagnosis into moral verdicts or outcome-ranking claims.

## Where the lens does not help

- Rollback is cheap, local, and symmetric.
- Effects are ephemeral and do not propagate.
- Activity is exploratory or non-binding, and downstream commitments do not form.

## Apparent counterexamples (brief)

- Thought: reversibility appears high, but attention and memory updates can persist.
- Simulation: outputs can remain "virtual" while decisions and coordination effects persist.
- Speech: utterances retract, while reputation and coordination effects can persist.

## Misuse patterns

- Moralizing structural terms (blame in place of cost routing).
- Overapplication (treating all disagreement as accounting failure).
- Confusing intent with impact (treating motives as a substitute for persistence tracking).
- Turning diagnosis into prescriptions (instrument becomes outcome-ranking).
