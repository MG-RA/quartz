# Irreversibility Lens - Failure Signatures

Tags: #diagnostic

> [!note]
> Scope: These are failure signatures of analyses, not claims about the system under study.

Recurring diagnostic failures that appear across domains.

## 1) Reversal narrative without erasure work

- Signature: "fixed" is asserted without stating removal work.
- Looks like: rollback invoked as sufficient.
- Hidden: erasure cost displaced or deferred.

## 2) Persistence without transformation space

- Signature: persistence is claimed without specifying what changes count.
- Looks like: "it doesn't go away" without scope.
- Hidden: persistence is un-auditable; boundary drift.

## 3) Local optimization masking non-local costs

- Signature: success metrics improve while downstream burdens accumulate.
- Looks like: "we reduced errors" with missing cost location.
- Hidden: displacement into other subsystems/time horizons.

## 4) Reification of bookkeeping terms

- Signature: bookkeeping words treated as measurable substances.
- Looks like: demand for units or optimization targets.
- Hidden: slide into pseudo-measurement and prescription-by-metric.

## 5) Diagnosis->prescription drift

- Signature: diagnostic output becomes an action mandate.
- Looks like: the diagnostic output is presented as an action mandate without value criteria.
- Hidden: normative load imported under structural language.

## 6) Moralization of structure

- Signature: structural patterns used as moral verdicts.
- Looks like: blame attached where only routing is specified.
- Hidden: intent substituted for cost accounting.

## 7) Saturation misread as stability

- Signature: lack of movement interpreted as success.
- Looks like: "nothing is happening" as evidence of resolution.
- Hidden: constraint load has eliminated alternatives.

## 8) Absorption invisibility

- Signature: "no displacement" inferred from lack of narrative.
- Looks like: "costs were absorbed" without tracing.
- Hidden: local absorption work remains untracked and becomes invisible.

## 9) Collapse surfaces treated as inevitability

- Signature: conditional boundaries become certainty claims.
- Looks like: "doomed" replaces IF/THEN statements.
- Hidden: loss of conditional reasoning; premature closure.

## 10) Lens self-exemption

- Signature: the lens is treated as exempt from its own failure modes.
- Looks like: scope and misuse checks drop out over time.
- Hidden: interpretive power accumulates without accounting.
