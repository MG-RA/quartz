# Callout Style Guide

Purpose: Use callouts only as boundary markers (scope limits, non-claims, validity limits, misuse risks, and reader orientation). Callouts are not decoration and should not add emphasis.

## Allowed callouts

- `[!warning]` Misuse risk, failure modes, boundary violations, or ways the lens can overreach.
- `[!note]` Interpretation constraints: scope limits, non-claims, definitions-only sections, or "what this is not".
- `[!info]` Navigation/orientation: what this section is for and how to read it.

## Forbidden uses

Do not use callouts to:
- Highlight importance ("key", "important", "remember", "takeaway")
- Summarize or conclude ("in summary", "this proves", "therefore")
- Persuade or motivate

## Rules

- **Minimalism rule:** If removing a callout would not increase misuse risk, omit it.
- **Avoid governance rule:** Avoid process/ownership language (e.g., "maintainers", "policy", "review", "enforce", "must comply").

## Approved templates (copy/paste)

> [!note]
> Scope: This section constrains interpretation; it does not argue for conclusions.

> [!note]
> Non-claim: This is diagnostic framing only; it does not recommend actions or outcomes.

> [!note]
> What this is not: a moral judgment, a theory of intent, or a prediction.

> [!warning]
> Validity limit: Do not apply this outside the stated transformation space/time window.

> [!warning]
> Misuse risk: Treating bookkeeping terms as measurements or optimizable quantities.

> [!warning]
> False-positive risk: Alternative explanations may fit; avoid defaulting to one diagnosis.

> [!info]
> Orientation: This section defines scope/terms; read before applying the lens.
