# <Mechanism Name>

## Definition

Describe the operator-pattern this mechanism instantiates.
Focus on *what it does*, not why it exists or whether it is desirable.

## Preconditions

List the structural conditions required for the mechanism to function as intended.
Include scope assumptions, authority assumptions, and state requirements.

## Operation

Describe the state transition this mechanism performs.
Use neutral A → B language where possible.

## Residuals

Describe what **persists after the mechanism completes**.
Include:
- state changes without a current owner
- displaced or deferred costs
- constraints introduced or tightened
- information loss or distortion

Do **not** describe outcomes or intentions. Residuals are structural remainders.

## Interaction with Accounting

Specify what must be tracked, attributed, or logged for this mechanism to remain coherent.
Note common accounting failures related to this mechanism.

## Failure Modes

Describe how this mechanism breaks, degrades, or produces harm when:
- overused
- mis-scoped
- invoked outside its valid preconditions

## Governance & Attribution

Specify:
- who can invoke this mechanism
- who is responsible for its residuals
- who can halt or contain it

## Related Concepts

Link to relevant concepts (e.g. [[residual]], [[persistent-difference]], [[constraint-load]]).

## Examples

Provide 2–3 brief, concrete examples across different domains.

## Why this template change matters (brief, structural)

- Residuals become mandatory without being moralized.
- Mechanisms stop pretending to be clean operations.
- Accounting is pulled downstream of operation, where it belongs.
- Governance and attribution stop hiding inside prose.
