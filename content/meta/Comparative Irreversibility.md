# Comparative Irreversibility

## Thesis

Irreversibility can be used as a comparative instrument:

> Apply the lens to different domains to extract handling patterns that survive constraint, not to explain mechanisms away.

The guiding question is not "what exists?" or "what causes what?", but:

> What must be preserved, displaced, or accounted for once reversal is no longer available?

## Method (as a repeatable loop)

Treat a domain as a corpus of irreversible transitions:

1) Identify irreversible transitions (where undo is not cheap).
2) Observe what the system does to remain coherent after the transition.
3) Classify the handling pattern (operator-pattern).
4) Check transfer: does the pattern recur in other domains?
5) Promote stable recurrences to candidate invariants (make them falsifiable).

This is a specific instance of [[isomorphism|Constraint Isomorphism]].

## Common handling patterns

These show up in nature, institutions, software, and cognition once irreversibility dominates:

### Pattern A: Horizons (boundary formation)

When internal detail can no longer be freely coordinated, systems route interaction through boundary residues.

- See: [[horizon]], [[boundary]], [[containment]]

### Pattern B: Displacement instead of destruction

State is rarely annihilated. It is rerouted: smeared, deferred, encoded non-locally, or reduced to statistics.

- See: [[displacement]], [[residual]]

### Pattern C: Compression under constraint

As options collapse, description compresses. Summaries replace full access.

- See: [[residual]] (named remainder), [[constraint-load]]

### Pattern D: Ledgerization

Irreversible action produces records, traces, witnesses, or strata that future coordination must reference.

- See: [[Maintenance Accounting]], [[admissibility]]

### Pattern E: Partial orders

Once irreversibility appears, ordering matters. "Before/after" becomes structural, not just narrative.

- See: [[admissibility]], [[boundary-crossing]]

## Candidate invariant chain (v0)

These are deliberately sharp (and therefore testable):

- No irreversible process without residue.
- No residue without a boundary.
- No boundary without loss of locality.
- No loss of locality without displacement.
- No displacement without accounting.
- No accounting without compression.

If a system behaves as if one link in the chain does not apply, expect [[accounting-failure]].

## Practical use

This note exists to prevent a recurring failure mode:

> Treating horizons as reversible, and treating residues as noise.

When a horizon exists, the correct move is not optimism. It is explicit accounting:

- name what crossed the horizon
- name what boundary residues remain
- name what compensatory structure would be required to reconstruct
