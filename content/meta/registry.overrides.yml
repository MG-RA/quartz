concept_overrides:
  transformation-space:
    role: declared scope for persistence claims
  constraint:
    role: restriction on transitions
  difference:
    role: what changes / what is tracked
  persistence:
    role: what remains across change
  erasure-cost:
    role: removal work / burden location
    hub_class: Primitive hub
  asymmetry:
    role: non-symmetric cost structure
  accumulation:
    role: stacking of constraints
  irreversibility-quanta:
    role: minimum action-sized difference whose erasure exports cost beyond local system

  persistent-difference:
    role: re-identifiable persistence within scope
  erasure-asymmetry:
    role: production vs removal imbalance
  displacement:
    role: where removal work relocates
  absorption:
    role: where removal work is paid locally
  propagation:
    role: how differences copy/spread
  residual:
    role: persistent remainder left after mechanisms act
    hub_class: Mechanism-output hub
  constraint-load:
    role: accumulated incompatibilities (bookkeeping)
    hub_class: Aggregation hub
  constraint-accumulation:
    role: process by which load grows
  irreversibility:
    role: composite relation across persistence and costs
  persistence-gradient:
    role: "\"for whom is this irreversible?\""

  rollback:
    role: mechanism that can appear sufficient locally
  containment:
    role: boundary operator that limits propagation
  quarantine:
    role: isolation operator with gated reintegration
  ratchet:
    role: one-way tightening operator that accumulates constraints
  deprecation:
    role: staged withdrawal operator that leaves legacy residue
  migration:
    role: transition operator that relocates structure under coordination

  tracking-mechanism:
    role: what makes costs legible / traceable
  accounting-failure:
    role: when costs persist without tracking
  feasible-set:
    role: set of transitions remaining structurally available
  collapse-surface:
    role: conditional boundary where options disappear

  brittleness:
    role: small perturbations -> disproportionate failure
  saturation:
    role: no room to move; options reduce to maintenance

  lens:
    role: meta-concept for the diagnostic operator
  admissibility:
    role: what transitions remain coherent
