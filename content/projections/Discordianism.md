# Discordianism

> [!note]
> Non-claim: This is a structural re-reading, not doctrine or metaphysics.

## Original framing
- Satire and paradox as anti-canon devices ("seriousness" treated as a failure mode).
- "Do not believe" posture as a block on belief persistence.
- Meaning is treated as a movable frame; frames are swapped rather than defended as final.

## What problem this system was responding to
- Canon formation and authority capture via fixed interpretation.
- Identity binding to propositions, producing high erasure cost for updating.
- Self-sealing explanations that convert disagreement into evidence.

## Implicit constraint insight
- Satire reduces copyable doctrine density by lowering semantic closure.
- "Do not believe" acts like an explicit rollback clause for interpretation.
- Paradox blocks totalizing explanation by making stable inference paths unreliable.

## Anti-patterns it was avoiding
- Metaphysical seriousness as a route to canon and coercive certainty.
- Single-frame dominance ("one true map") under ambiguity.
- Status extraction via correct belief display.

## Failure mode under scale
- Irony collapses into identity: the anti-belief posture becomes a badge.
- Meme-hardening: jokes become persistent differences that propagate faster than their context.
- Ambiguity becomes cover: responsibility and tracking dissolve into performative uncertainty.

## Re-interpretation under irreversibility
- Satire can be rollback-friendly locally but propagation makes effects persistent at the discourse level.
- Erasure cost rises when "ironic" frames become default coordination layers (shared references, in-groups).
- Displacement risk: interpretive and coordination costs route to outsiders and newcomers.

## What survives translation
- Anti-canon mechanisms as checks against self-sealing diagnostics.
- Frame-swapping as a tool for generating non-totalizing alternative explanations.

## What must not be imported
- Identity recruitment via in-group signaling.
- Harassment cover via "it was just a joke."
- Any claim that irony eliminates persistence or accountability.

## Mechanisms (operator-patterns implied)
- **Rollback**: “do not believe” acts as an explicit rollback clause for interpretation, attempting to keep commitment reversible. [[rollback]]
- **Containment**: satire/paradox constrains closure by making stable inference paths unreliable (limits what can propagate as canon). [[containment]]
- **Deprecation**: frame-swapping can function as staged withdrawal from any single “final map,” leaving legacy references behind. [[deprecation]]

## Residuals (named remainder)
- Meme-hardening: jokes become [[residual|residuals]] that persist and propagate faster than their context. [[propagation]]
- Displaced coordination/interpretive costs onto outsiders and newcomers who lack the context to reverse effects. [[displacement]]
- Identity binding to “anti-belief” posture that accumulates [[constraint-load]] for later updates (irony as a one-way badge).
