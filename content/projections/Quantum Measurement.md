# Quantum Measurement

> [!note]
> Non-claim: This is a structural re-reading, not doctrine or metaphysics.

## Original framing
- Unitary evolution as the default: time-reversible, information-preserving, CPT-safe.
- Measurement as a special operation where outcomes are selected, alternatives discarded, and records created.
- Decoherence as the mechanism explaining why interference disappears and classicality emerges.
- Interpretation debates (Copenhagen, Many-Worlds, etc.) as attempts to locate where "the real change" happens.

## What problem this system was responding to
- Reconciling deterministic, reversible wave evolution with the appearance of definite outcomes.
- Explaining why macroscopic systems behave classically despite quantum substrates.
- Preserving time-reversal symmetry at the fundamental level while accommodating observed asymmetry.

## Implicit constraint insight
- Measurement is where physics openly admits something irreversible happens, then immediately reframes it as epistemic update.
- Decoherence explains why interference vanishes but does not track what was discarded or assign [[erasure-cost]].
- "In principle reversible" is preserved by noting that total environmental control could restore coherence; "in practice" the cost explodes combinatorially.
- The gap between logical invertibility and practical erasure cost is the entire issue, but the formalism has no ledger for it.

## Anti-patterns it was avoiding
- Privileging observers or consciousness as causally special.
- Introducing fundamental randomness without derivation from deeper structure.
- Breaking time-reversal symmetry at the base layer of physics.
- Treating macroscopic records as ontologically distinct from microscopic states.

## Failure mode under scale
- Measurement is pushed to the edges: treated as perspective, approximation, or bookkeeping convenience.
- No mechanism tracks where irreversibility accumulates when decoherence "discards" phase information.
- Interpretation debates recycle without resolution because the accounting question is never directly posed.
- "For all practical purposes" becomes a substitute for structural analysis of what cannot be undone.

## Re-interpretation under irreversibility
- A detector click is not just knowledge update; it is a new durable fact—a [[persistent-difference]] that resists erasure.
- Measurement produces constraint creation, not description update: future admissible actions change, alternatives become inaccessible.
- Decoherence marks where the ledger goes missing; correlations declared "irrelevant" without tracking cost or destination.
- If measurement were treated as fundamental, some histories would be genuinely forbidden, not merely inaccessible in practice.

## What survives translation
- Recognition that specific facts, records, and outcomes constitute structural asymmetry, not mere ignorance.
- Decoherence as a useful model for when interference becomes negligible, without claiming erasure is free.
- Precision about what "same state" means under different transformation spaces.

## What must not be imported
- Observer-centrism or consciousness-causes-collapse readings.
- "In principle reversible" as a dismissal of practical [[erasure-cost]] asymmetry.
- Interpretation allegiance as a substitute for accounting discipline.
- Treating measurement as solved by decoherence when decoherence itself defers the cost question.
