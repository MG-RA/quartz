# Cosmology

> [!note]
> Non-claim: This is a structural re-reading, not doctrine or metaphysics.

## Original framing
- Time-reversible dynamical equations at the core: Einstein field equations, classical field theory, quantum field dynamics all preserve symmetry under time reversal.
- Entropy increase treated as statistical typicality ("overwhelming probability"), not structural necessity.
- CPT symmetry as a foundational commitment: time reversal preserved at the fundamental level even if violated locally.
- Arrow of time derived from initial conditions, not from dynamics; all asymmetry front-loaded into an unexplained low-entropy beginning.

## What problem this system was responding to
- Deriving macroscopic behavior from microscopic laws without invoking special or designed features.
- Explaining cosmic evolution from simple, universal principles rather than from purpose or teleology.
- Maintaining predictive power by treating the universe as a closed system governed by invertible equations.

## Implicit constraint insight
- "In principle reversible" preserves logical invertibility at the cost of ignoring practical cost asymmetry.
- Coarse-graining implicitly defines a transformation space under which discarded correlations are declared non-identifying, rather than erased at cost.
- Decoherence functions as cleanup (explaining classicality) without registering as cost creation.
- All irreversibility is front-loaded: the universe "unfolds" asymmetry but never structurally produces it.
- Persistence is framed as epistemic loss (we lose track) rather than ontological accumulation (something is made).

## Anti-patterns it was avoiding
- Teleology: purpose-driven explanations for cosmic structure or evolution.
- Vitalism: special ontological status for observers, life, or consciousness.
- Fundamental asymmetry at the base layer: preserving CPT symmetry keeps time reversal available in principle.
- Anthropic privilege: treating the existence of observers as explanatorily primary.

## Failure mode under scale
- No accounting exists for where erasure costs accumulate; the ledger stops at "statistically irrelevant."
- Observation, measurement, and agency become "mere perspectives" with no structural role.
- Black hole information paradox reveals the tension: reversibility in principle vs. practical, possibly permanent loss.
- Arrow of time remains emergent and statistical; no mechanism explains why practical reversal is forbidden rather than unlikely.
- Inflation and decoherence grant structure "for free," as if amplification and phase discarding had no bill.

## Re-interpretation under irreversibility
- If irreversibility were primitive, initial conditions would no longer carry all explanatory weight for asymmetry.
- Some histories would be genuinely forbidden, not merely statistically suppressed.
- The arrow of time becomes structural (certain transitions cannot be undone) rather than statistical (certain transitions are unlikely to be undone).
- Persistence treated as ontological accumulation: differences that resist erasure are real features, not bookkeeping artifacts.
- Measurement and observation may function as sites where [[persistent-difference|persistent differences]] are registered and exported, rather than merely revealed.

## What survives translation
- Constraint against explanatory overreach: not everything is "meant to be" or designed.
- Recognition that local reversibility can coexist with global asymmetry; micro-dynamics need not encode macro-arrows.
- Mathematical precision about transformation spaces and what counts as "same state."
- Resistance to ad hoc exceptions or special pleading in fundamental physics.

## What must not be imported
- "In principle reversible" as a dismissal of practical [[erasure-cost]] asymmetry.
- Statistical explanation as a substitute for structural accounting of where persistence lands.
- Assumption that all irreversibility is either front-loaded (initial conditions) or emergent (coarse-graining).
- Treating the absence of a reversal mechanism as equivalent to reversal being possible.
