# Stoicism

> [!note]
> Non-claim: This is a structural re-reading, not doctrine or metaphysics.

## Original framing
- Control vs not-control as a boundary on where evaluation and effort can land.
- Internal stance as a stable interface under variable external conditions.
- "Virtue" language exists historically; here it is treated as a constraint format, not a moral ranking.

## What problem this system was responding to
- Volatile environments where external outcomes are high-variance and weakly controllable.
- Collapse of agency via over-attribution to external state and other actors.
- Emotional/attention capture by non-local dependencies that cannot be resolved locally.

## Implicit constraint insight
- Constrains the action surface by routing claims to an internal ledger (intent, judgment, attention).
- Reduces dependence on external rollback claims ("if X changes, then I'm fine") by shrinking the required reversibility set.
- Produces a stable transformation space for "self" by declaring what updates count.

## Anti-patterns it was avoiding
- Reactive oscillation driven by external shocks.
- Blame-transfer as an explanatory move (externalizing control without tracking erasure cost).
- Totalizing narratives that convert every outcome into a judgment of the actor.

## Failure mode under scale
- Rigidity: the control boundary becomes a refusal to model real external constraints.
- Moralization: "inner control" becomes status and condemnation rather than diagnosis.
- Accounting bypass: systemic displacement is redescribed as individual attitude failure.

## Re-interpretation under irreversibility
- "Route inward" can be absorption (cost paid locally) or displacement (cost pushed onto the self) depending on what is being tracked.
- Under scale, moralized Stoicism increases constraint load by narrowing admissible interpretations ("only one correct stance").
- Failure risk aligns with lens-induced rigidity and diagnosis->prescription drift.

## What survives translation
- A boundary tool for separating persistence-management from wishful rollback narratives.
- A check against conflating explanation with control (agency != outcome ownership).

## What must not be imported
- Virtue language as a ranking of persons.
- "Accept it" framing used to erase displacement and accounting failure.
- Claims that internal stance substitutes for tracking external persistence.
