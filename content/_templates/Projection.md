# {{Projection Name}}

## Original framing
- 

## What problem this system was responding to
- 

## Implicit constraint insight
- 

## Mechanisms (operator-patterns implied)
- Name the operator-patterns this projection relies on (verb shelf).
- Map to existing mechanism notes where possible (e.g., [[rollback]], [[containment]], [[quarantine]], [[ratchet]], [[deprecation]], [[migration]]).
- If no good mapping exists, describe the operator-pattern without creating new concepts.

## Residuals (named remainder)
- What persists after the projection’s mechanisms “complete.” [[residual]]
- What accumulates as constraints / narrowed options. [[constraint-load]]
- What gets displaced across time/actors/systems. [[displacement]]

Avoid outcomes/intentions; name structural remainders.

## Interaction with Accounting
- What would have to be tracked for coherence. [[tracking-mechanism]]
- Where it becomes consistent with untracked/misattributed residuals. [[accounting-failure]]

## Anti-patterns it was avoiding
- 

## Failure mode under scale
- 

## Re-interpretation under irreversibility
- 

## Failure-state mapping (when applicable)
- [[brittleness]]
- [[saturation]]
- [[collapse-surface]]

## What survives translation
- 

## What must not be imported
-
