Use: [[Projection]]

## Source framing (as given)

- What this system says the world is like (its “base layer” claims).
- What it treats as reversible vs irreversible (explicitly or implicitly).
- What it treats as inside scope vs outside scope.

## What problem it was responding to

- What failure it is trying to prevent (without assuming intent is correct).
- What kind of uncertainty or volatility it is compressing.

## Implicit constraint insight

- What it forbids, de-prioritizes, or routes away (often without naming it).
- Where it hides accounting by calling things “mere perspective,” “noise,” or “just interpretation.”

## Mechanisms (operator-patterns implied)

Name the operator-patterns the projection relies on (verb shelf), and map them to mechanism concepts when possible:
- e.g., [[rollback]], [[containment]], [[quarantine]], [[ratchet]], [[deprecation]], [[migration]]

If no good mapping exists, describe the operator-pattern without creating new concepts.

## Residuals (named remainder)

State what persists after the projection’s mechanisms “complete”:
- what gets left behind without a current owner ([[residual]])
- what accumulates as constraints or narrowed options ([[constraint-load]])
- what is displaced across time/actors/systems ([[displacement]])

Avoid outcomes/intentions; name structural remainders.

## Interaction with Accounting

- What would have to be tracked for this projection to stay coherent ([[tracking-mechanism]]).
- Where it becomes consistent with [[accounting-failure]] (untracked residuals, contested attribution, invisible displacement).

## Failure mode under scale

Map the characteristic breakdowns to failure states when applicable:
- [[brittleness]] (small perturbations -> large option loss)
- [[saturation]] (no admissible room left to adapt)
- [[collapse-surface]] (conditional boundary where options disappear)

## What survives translation

- Structural constraints that remain useful without importing doctrine/metaphysics.

## What must not be imported

- Any move that treats “in principle reversible” as a dismissal of [[erasure-cost]].
- Any move that moralizes residuals or collapses diagnosis into prescription.

## Links

- Target concept links used in this projection (keep tight; no taxonomy sprawl).
