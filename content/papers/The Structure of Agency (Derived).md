## 0. Orientation and Scope

This document offers a **constraint-first interpretation of agency** under conditions where irreversible accumulation constrains action.

It does **not** propose a fundamental ontology of agency, consciousness, freedom, or value. Instead, it assumes the diagnostic concepts introduced in [[Irreversibility Accounting (Paper)]] and asks a narrower question:

> **Where does agency operate once irreversibility is taken seriously?**

This interpretation is relevant in regimes where:
- actions produce [[persistent-difference|persistent differences]]
- [[rollback|rollback]] is asymmetric or costly
- [[constraint-accumulation|constraint accumulation]] dominates over novelty

It is less informative in novelty-dominant or reversibility-dominant regimes (e.g. early exploration, low-stakes trial-and-error, artistic experimentation).

---

## 1. Preconditions (Assumed, Not Re-derived)

This paper **does not restate** the following concepts. It assumes them as given:

- [[persistent-difference]]
- [[erasure-cost]] and [[erasure-asymmetry]]
- [[displacement]] and [[absorption]]
- [[constraint-load]] and [[constraint-accumulation]]
- [[collapse-surface]]

Together, these establish a regime in which accumulated persistence shapes the space of admissible action.

---

## 2. Agency Reclassified

Within accumulation-dominated regimes, agency is reclassified.

Agency is **not** treated as:
- the origin of causality
- the generator of possibility
- the source of freedom

Instead:

> **Agency is the capacity of a localized system to select among admissible transitions given an existing pattern of accumulated constraints.**

Agents do not choose the space of possibilities.  
They select **paths within it**.

Agency appears wherever constraints are:
- sufficiently dense to matter
- but not yet total

---

## 3. Agency as Compression

Agency functions as a **compression layer**.

Compression is used here in a functional sense: the reduction of a high-dimensional constraint field into a low-dimensional decision surface sufficient for action. This is not a claim about a specific algorithm or computation model.

Agency-as-compression:
- aggregates many micro-constraints into a tractable interface
- enables action under complexity
- supports attribution in distributed causality

Compression does not create possibilities.  
It makes **navigation** possible.

In this sense, agency resembles other control interfaces:
- steering mechanisms
- compilers
- dashboards

Its function is **tractability**, not generation.

---

## 4. Degrees of Agency

Agency varies continuously with constraint density.

- **High agency**: many admissible transitions, low [[erasure-cost]]
- **Medium agency**: choices exist but trade persistence
- **Low agency**: choices primarily redirect irreversibility
- **Zero agency**: only one admissible transition remains

This variation is **structural**, not moral or psychological.

---

## 5. Strong and Weak Agency (Viability Sense)

The distinction between strong and weak agency is introduced **as a viability distinction**, not a value judgment.

- **Weak agency** emphasizes:
  - preference satisfaction
  - expressive choice
  - local optimization

- **Strong agency** refers to:

> **The capacity to absorb, localize, or deliberately route irreversible effects without amplifying [[constraint-accumulation]] elsewhere.**

In accumulation-dominated regimes, agents that cannot manage where persistence lands lose effective agency over time.

Strong agency often appears as restraint, refusal of leverage, or limitation—not expansion.

---

## 6. Intent, Meaning, and Values

Intentions, meanings, and values are treated as **downstream coordination mechanisms**.

They:
- bias selection among admissible transitions
- shape interpretation of outcomes
- support alignment among agents

They do **not**, by themselves, alter [[constraint-load]] or eliminate [[persistent-difference|persistence]].

Confusing intention with impact becomes especially costly in irreversible regimes.

---

## 7. Authority as a Derived Structure

Authority is treated functionally, not normatively.

> **Authority is a meta-constraint that serializes which actions update shared persistence structures.**

Its role is to:
- coordinate irreversible updates
- prevent uncontrolled accumulation
- manage proximity to [[collapse-surface|collapse surfaces]]

Authority persists only when backed by effective [[tracking-mechanism|tracking mechanisms]] and sufficient [[absorption]] capacity.

---

## 8. Modern Agency as a Regime Shift

In contemporary large-scale systems:
- [[constraint-accumulation]] is rapid
- rollback capacity grows slowly
- coupling is tight
- collapse surfaces are distant from individual actors

Under these conditions:
- agency becomes allocative rather than generative
- decisions route damage rather than create options
- responsibility shifts from intention to persistence management

This represents not a loss of agency, but a **change in its operating regime**.

---

## 9. Structural Ordering (Sufficient, Not Absolute)

For systems operating under irreversible accumulation, the following ordering is **sufficient for analysis**:

1. [[persistent-difference|Persistence]]
2. [[erasure-asymmetry|Irreversibility]]
3. [[constraint-load]] / [[constraint-accumulation]]
4. Agency
5. Intent, meaning, values

This ordering is not claimed as universally fundamental.  
It is claimed as **structurally adequate where accumulation dominates**.

### Excluded Explanatory Moves (Under These Conditions)

In such regimes, the following explanations fail to remain coherent:
- agency-first accounts that treat agency as possibility generation
- assumptions that local rollback restores global options
- intent–impact equivalence as a primary explanatory driver
- freedom treated as option count without persistence tracking
- local optimization treated as restoring global flexibility

---

## 10. Conclusion

This account does not explain why the world moves.

It explains **how action is routed once movement is constrained**.

> **Agency is freedom under constraint, not freedom from it.**
