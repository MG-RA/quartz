*A constraint-first interpretation of agency in accumulation-dominated regimes.*

## 0. Orientation and Scope

This document offers a **constraint-first interpretation of agency** under conditions where irreversible accumulation constrains action.

It does **not** propose a fundamental ontology of agency, consciousness, freedom, or value. Instead, it assumes the core concept spine defined in `/concepts` and assembled in [[Irreversibility Accounting (Registry)]] and asks a narrower question:

> [!note]
> Scope: Derived interpretation; not an ontology of agency, consciousness, freedom, or value.

> **Where does agency operate once irreversibility is taken seriously?**

The ontology note flags an **agency boundary**: agency is not primitive; it emerges at the interface of [[feasible-set]], [[admissibility]], [[constraint-load]], and [[displacement]] / [[absorption]]. This paper is the derived articulation of that boundary. [[Ontology of Irreversibility#Agency boundary (derived)]]

This derivation is also **invariant-first**: agency claims are treated as structurally meaningful only when they remain coherent under all four invariants:
- [[Irreversibility (Invariant)]] (persistence and cost-routing)
- [[Decomposition]] (role separation so agency doesn't become a category error)
- [[Governance]] (constraint surfaces and non-exemption)
- [[Attribution]] (control surfaces, degrees of freedom, and agency layers)

This interpretation is relevant in regimes where:
- actions produce [[persistent-difference|persistent differences]]
- [[rollback|rollback]] is asymmetric or costly
- [[constraint-accumulation|constraint accumulation]] dominates over novelty

It is less informative in novelty-dominant or reversibility-dominant regimes (e.g. early exploration, low-stakes trial-and-error, artistic experimentation).

### Minimal derivation sketch (where "agency" enters)

The explanatory spine stays fixed:

```
[[persistent-difference]]
        ->
[[erasure-cost]] / [[erasure-asymmetry]]
        ->
[[residual]]
        ->
[[constraint-load]] / [[constraint-accumulation]]
        ->
[[admissibility]] / [[feasible-set]]
```

Agency enters only once there is a **non-trivial boundary** between admissible and inadmissible moves: a situation where a localized system can still select among multiple admissible transitions, but selection changes where the next [[irreversibility-quanta|irreversibility quantum]] lands.

### Four-invariant localization (what makes an agency claim well-formed here)

In this vault, "agency" is not a free-floating property. An agency claim is only as good as the structural anchors it names.

At minimum, an agency claim should be able to answer:
- **What is the role?** (declared [[role-boundary]]; avoid [[role-collapse]])
- **What layer of agency is being claimed?** ([[agency-layer]]; avoid [[layer-collapse]])
- **What can the role vary?** ([[control-surface]] + [[degrees-of-freedom]])
- **What constrains the move?** ([[constraint-surface]] + [[admissibility]] / [[feasible-set]])
- **Where does persistence land?** ([[persistent-difference]] + [[displacement]] / [[absorption]] + [[residual]])
- **Who is exempt (if anyone)?** ([[exemption]] / [[exemption-path]]; governance non-exemption is the stabilizer)

### Regime detection (convergent symptoms)

No single indicator is decisive. When several of these appear together, you're likely in an accumulation-dominant regime even if surface innovation is high:

- rollback restores local state but does not restore global options ([[rollback]] + non-local [[erasure-cost]])
- the [[feasible-set|feasible set]] does not reopen after repeated fixes (option non-restoration)
- small reforms trigger disproportionate option loss under coupling ([[brittleness]])
- preserving function increasingly requires shims/exceptions that persist as [[residual|residuals]] ([[constraint-accumulation]])
- once crossed, prior states are not reachable at comparable cost ([[irreversibility]])

### Novelty taxonomy (diagnostic, not a law)

This framework treats "novelty" as a structural classification, not a celebration term.

- **Local novelty:** new configurations inside an existing regime (new features, new tactics, new phrasing) that do not sustainably expand the feasible set; often redistributes or displaces costs.
- **Transformational novelty:** sustained expansion of admissible transitions that survives stress without exporting hidden erasure costs; rare, but real.
- **Regime-shift novelty:** changes the substrate/coupling conditions such that what counts as feasible changes (new coordination capacity, new interfaces, new transformation space); can temporarily break accumulation patterns.

#### Coherence question (diagnostic)

For a claimed "transformational" move: would the option expansion survive adversarial replay without exporting hidden erasure work?

In other words: not "did we grow," but "did the growth remain coherent under stress without silently routing its [[erasure-cost|erasure costs]] elsewhere?"

#### Conservation pattern (regime-conditional)

In accumulation-dominant regimes, option expansion often appears "conserved" as a strong pattern: apparent gains are offset by new constraints somewhere else (finite coordination capacity + persistence coupling + asymmetric erasure).

This is not a law. Breaks are expected in:

- early-stage, low-coupling exploration
- genuinely new substrates/interfaces that reduce coupling
- contexts with real local absorption capacity (costs are paid down, not displaced)

---

## 1. Preconditions (Assumed, Not Re-derived)

This paper is derived under the four invariant constraints:
- [[Irreversibility (Invariant)]]: persistence exists under a declared [[transformation-space]], and erasure work has non-local, asymmetric cost ([[erasure-cost]], [[erasure-asymmetry]]).
- [[Decomposition]]: we keep objects/operators/boundaries/accounting/governance roles explicit so "agency" doesn't collapse into an operator, a value judgment, or a scope error.
- [[Governance]]: constraints must apply to their own authors/enforcers (no interpretive immunity); exemptions are visible as exemptions.
- [[Attribution]]: agency is layered, and responsibility claims must be indexed to actual [[degrees-of-freedom]] on a declared [[control-surface]].

This paper also **does not restate** the following irreversibility primitives. It assumes them as given:

- [[persistent-difference]]
- [[erasure-cost]] and [[erasure-asymmetry]]
- [[displacement]] and [[absorption]]
- [[constraint-load]] and [[constraint-accumulation]]
- [[collapse-surface]]

Together, these establish a regime in which accumulated persistence shapes the space of admissible action.

---

## 2. Agency Reclassified

Within accumulation-dominated regimes, agency is reclassified.

Agency is **not** treated as:
- the origin of causality
- the generator of possibility
- the source of freedom

Instead:

> **Agency is the capacity of a localized role to vary a [[control-surface]] (within its [[degrees-of-freedom]]) to select among [[admissibility|admissible]] transitions, given an existing pattern of accumulated constraints.**

Agents do not choose the space of possibilities.  
They select **paths within it**.

Agency appears wherever constraints are:
- sufficiently dense to matter
- but not yet total

### Agency in the irreversibility-quanta sense (routing, not avoidance)

Agency is not the freedom to avoid irreversibility. Agency is the capacity to choose where the next [[irreversibility-quanta|irreversibility quantum]] lands. Strong agency localizes and contains quanta. Weak agency disperses them while assuming future rollback. [[irreversibility-quanta#Relation to agency]]

### Agency is layered (attribution discipline)

Under [[Attribution]], "agency" is not a single kind of control:
- **Causal agency:** mechanisms produce effects (difference happens) without implying intent.
- **Intentional agency:** an actor selects among perceived options and constraints.
- **Structural / governance agency:** roles/tools change the constraint landscape itself (rules, interfaces, enforcement).

In accumulation-dominant regimes, analysis fails most often by sliding between these layers (e.g., treating structural effects as if they were individual intent). The minimal correction is to name the [[agency-layer]] and the [[degrees-of-freedom]] being claimed.

---

## 3. Agency as Compression

Agency functions as a **compression layer**.

Compression is used here in a functional sense: the reduction of a high-dimensional constraint field into a low-dimensional decision surface sufficient for action. This is not a claim about a specific algorithm or computation model.

Agency-as-compression:
- aggregates many micro-constraints into a tractable interface
- enables action under complexity
- supports attribution in distributed causality (by making a usable decision surface, which can then be audited as a [[control-surface]])

Compression does not create possibilities.  
It makes **navigation** possible.

Compression also creates a governance and decomposition problem: what gets compressed can become uninspectable, and then "decision" quietly becomes "authority" (loss of [[self-diagnosability]], emergence of [[silent-correction]] paths). Naming the compression interface as a role-bound artifact is part of keeping the [[role-boundary]] explicit.

In this sense, agency resembles other control interfaces:
- steering mechanisms
- compilers
- dashboards

Its function is **tractability**, not generation.

---

## 4. Degrees of Agency

Agency varies continuously with constraint density.

- **High agency**: many admissible transitions; large [[degrees-of-freedom]] relative to [[constraint-load]]; low [[erasure-cost]]
- **Medium agency**: choices exist but trade persistence
- **Low agency**: choices primarily redirect irreversibility
- **Zero agency**: only one admissible transition remains

This variation is **structural**, not moral or psychological.

---

## 5. Strong and Weak Agency (Viability Sense)

The distinction between strong and weak agency is introduced **as a viability distinction**, not a value judgment.

- **Weak agency** emphasizes:
  - preference satisfaction
  - expressive choice
  - local optimization

- **Strong agency** refers to:

> **The capacity to absorb, localize, or deliberately route irreversible effects without amplifying [[constraint-accumulation]] elsewhere.**

In accumulation-dominated regimes, agents that cannot manage where persistence lands lose effective agency over time.

Strong agency often appears as restraint, refusal of leverage, or limitation, not expansion.

Under the other invariants, "strong agency" also implies:
- attribution does not drift into [[attribution-displacement]] (responsibility stays near control surfaces)
- governance does not drift into [[exemption-path]]s (no "rules for thee, not for me")
- decomposition does not drift into role confusion (no hidden operators inside object claims; no authority smuggled in as explanation)

---

## 6. Intent, Meaning, and Values

Intentions, meanings, and values are treated as **downstream coordination mechanisms**.

They:
- bias selection among admissible transitions
- shape interpretation of outcomes
- support alignment among agents

They do **not**, by themselves, alter [[constraint-load]] or eliminate [[persistent-difference|persistence]].

Confusing intention with impact becomes especially costly in irreversible regimes.

---

## 7. Authority as a Derived Structure

Authority is treated functionally, not normatively.

> **Authority is a meta-constraint (a [[constraint-surface]]) that serializes which actions update shared persistence structures.**

Its role is to:
- coordinate irreversible updates
- prevent uncontrolled accumulation
- manage proximity to [[collapse-surface|collapse surfaces]]

Authority persists only when backed by effective [[tracking-mechanism|tracking mechanisms]] and sufficient [[absorption]] capacity.

Governance failure occurs when authority acquires exemptions (or interpretive immunity) such that constraints no longer apply to their own enforcers. [[Governance]] [[interpretive-immunity]]

---

## 8. Modern Agency as a Regime Shift

In contemporary large-scale systems:
- [[constraint-accumulation]] is rapid
- rollback capacity grows slowly
- coupling is tight
- collapse surfaces are distant from individual actors

Under these conditions:
- agency becomes allocative rather than generative
- decisions route damage rather than create options
- responsibility shifts from intention to persistence management

This is also a shift in which agency layers dominate:
- intentional choice remains locally real but structurally bounded
- structural / governance agency increasingly determines what is admissible (and what violations are visible)
- attribution failures become common when responsibility claims ignore where [[degrees-of-freedom]] actually live

This represents not a loss of agency, but a **change in its operating regime**.

---

## 9. Structural Ordering (Sufficient, Not Absolute)

For systems operating under irreversible accumulation, the following ordering is **sufficient for analysis**:

1. [[persistent-difference|Persistence]]
2. [[irreversibility]] / [[erasure-asymmetry]]
3. [[constraint-load]] / [[constraint-accumulation]]
4. Agency
5. Intent, meaning, values

This ordering is not claimed as universally fundamental.  
It is claimed as **structurally adequate where accumulation dominates**.

### Excluded Explanatory Moves (Under These Conditions)

In such regimes, the following explanations fail to remain coherent:
- agency-first accounts that treat agency as possibility generation
- assumptions that local rollback restores global options
- intent-impact equivalence as a primary explanatory driver
- freedom treated as option count without persistence tracking
- local optimization treated as restoring global flexibility

### Orthogonality reminder (what the ordering does not collapse)

Even with the above ordering, the other invariants remain orthogonal checks:
- [[Attribution]]: did we name the actual control surface and degrees of freedom, at the correct agency layer?
- [[Governance]]: did we make exemptions visible, and keep constraints reflexive?
- [[Decomposition]]: did we keep roles separated so analysis stays mechanically checkable rather than interpretive?

---

## 10. Conclusion

This account does not explain why the world moves.

It explains **how action is routed once movement is constrained**.

> **Agency is freedom under constraint, not freedom from it.**
