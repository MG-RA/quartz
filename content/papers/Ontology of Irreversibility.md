# Ontology of Irreversibility — Structural Insights

> **Status:** Frozen orientation note
> 
> **Purpose:** Capture the ontology that emerged from concept-only graph analysis, latent hub detection, and hub obligations. This document describes _what exists_ in the framework and _how explanation flows_, not how to apply it.

---

## 1. What “ontology” means here

Ontology here is not metaphysical. It is **structural**:

- what kinds of things exist in the framework,
- which of them are load-bearing,
- which are operators,
- and where explanation is forced to pass.

If a concept can be removed without breaking explanation, it is scaffolding. If removal causes explanations to collapse into hand-waving, it is ontological.

---

## 2. Ontological spine (irreducible core)

The concept-only dependency graph reveals a stable spine that explanations repeatedly route through:

```
persistent-difference
        ↓
   erasure-cost
        ↓
     residual
        ↓
  constraint-load
        ↓
 admissibility / feasible-set
        ↓
 collapse-surface / saturation
```

This is not a narrative choice. It is enforced by in-degree concentration and shortest-path routing.

These concepts are **not interchangeable** and should not be flattened.

---

## 3. Hub classes (roles, not layers)

Latent hub detection identifies three distinct hub roles:

### Primitive hub — _erasure-cost_

- Grounds asymmetry
- Makes persistence testable
- Anchors irreversibility without mechanisms

### Mechanism-output hub — _residual_

- Names what remains after action
- Junction between mechanisms and accumulation
- Exists regardless of accounting

### Aggregation hub — _constraint-load_

- Integrates heterogeneous residuals
- Behaves like pressure, not count
- Governs admissibility collapse

Hubs are not promoted in layer rank. They are **obligations on explanation**.

---

## 4. Degree asymmetry and meaning

### High in-degree concepts

These are unavoidable explanatory junctions:

- persistent-difference
- erasure-cost
- residual
- displacement
- constraint-load

They ground explanation. They are depended on.

### High out-degree concepts

These are operators or diagnostics:

- accounting-failure
- ratchet
- quarantine
- migration
- rollback
- collapse-surface

They apply structure. Nothing explains them; they explain others.

This clean separation prevents action from being smuggled into ontology.

---

## 5. Mechanisms vs structure

Mechanisms:

- have near-zero in-degree
- high out-degree
- produce residuals
- never resolve persistence cleanly

Structure:

- has high in-degree
- low out-degree
- constrains what mechanisms can accomplish

There are no “clean” mechanisms in the ontology.

---

## 6. Diagnostics are peripheral by design

Concepts such as:

- lens
- tracking-mechanism
- registries

Remain peripheral in the concept-only graph.

This is a success condition:

- reality does not depend on observation
- diagnostics reveal structure, they do not constitute it

---

## 7. Agency boundary (not yet derived)

Agency does not appear as a primitive.

It emerges at the interface of:

- feasible-set
- admissibility
- constraint-load
- displacement / absorption

Agency must therefore be **derived**, not assumed.

---

## 8. Failure states

Failure states (brittleness, saturation, collapse-surface):

- have zero in-degree
- appear downstream of accumulation

Failure is not primary. It is the late-stage symptom of unmanaged persistence.

---

## 9. Invariants implied by the ontology

Without adding rules, the structure enforces:

- Persistence implies cost
- Action implies residue
- Untracked residue implies accumulation
- Accumulation implies loss of admissibility
- Reversibility claims must pay erasure costs

These are not ethical claims. They are conservation laws of explanation.

---

## 10. Role clarification

This ontology supports three distinct roles:

1. **Infrastructure explorer**  
    Discovers hubs, invariants, and load-bearing concepts.

2. **Framework steward**  
    Encodes obligations (templates, lint rules, registry hygiene).

3. **Diagnostician**  
    Applies the ontology to bounded domains without prescribing.


This document belongs to role (1).

---

## 11. Stability note

The ontology is considered stable when:

- hubs remain invariant under weighting changes
- the spine persists under graph isolation
- new concepts must route through existing junctions

At present, these conditions hold.

---

## 12. Non-claims

This ontology does **not**:

- prescribe action
- rank outcomes
- moralize persistence
- replace domain models

It constrains what explanations can coherently claim.

> **Frozen insight:**  
> When explanations are forced to route through the same concepts, those concepts are ontological — whether or not we intended them to be.
