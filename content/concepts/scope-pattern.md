# Scope Pattern

## Definition

A **scope pattern** is a reusable structural form for how a scope is drawn and maintained:

- what is in/out (boundary shape)
- which moves remain allowed (admissibility)
- how violations are detected (failure signatures)
- where irreversibility enters (what gets paid, and how it is witnessed)

Scope patterns are not domains and not prescriptions; they are vocabulary for making constraint shapes explicit so they can be checked and compared across domains.

## Structural dependencies
- [[boundary]]
- [[admissibility]]
- [[constraint]]
- [[irreversibility]]
- [[accounting-failure]]

## What this is NOT

- Not a domain taxonomy
- Not an implementation recipe
- Not a proof that a scope is valid

## Structural role

Scope patterns provide a mid-level compression: specific domains differ, but their scope boundaries often instantiate the same few structural shapes. Naming the pattern makes it easier to locate where the system must carry witnesses, and where untracked crossings produce accounting failure.
