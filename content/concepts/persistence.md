## Definition

**Persistence** is the property of a [[difference]] that remains re-identifiable across relevant transformations within a specified [[transformation-space]]. A difference persists when operations that might be expected to eliminate it fail to do so, or succeed only at non-trivial cost.

Persistence is not about duration but about **resistance to elimination**. A difference that lasts briefly but requires significant resources to remove is persistent. A difference that lasts long but vanishes with minimal effort is not.

## What this is NOT

- Not permanence (persistence is always relative to a transformation space)
- Not durability (durability concerns physical robustness; persistence concerns structural elimination)
- Not memory (memory is one mechanism; persistence is the general property)
- Not continuity (continuity is temporal; persistence is about re-identification under transformation)
- Not identity (identity is philosophical; persistence is operational)

## Structural role

Persistence converts a mere difference into a structurally relevant fact. It is the gateway concept: once a difference persists, questions of [[erasure-cost]], [[displacement]], and [[constraint-load]] become applicable. Without persistence, differences are noise. With it, they become the substrate of irreversibility accounting.
