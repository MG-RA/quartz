# Accumulation

Tags: #concept

Layer: primitive

## Definition

**Accumulation** is the stacking of [[constraint|constraints]] such that they do not cancel or dissipate locally. When constraints accumulate, their combined effect exceeds any single constraint's impact, progressively narrowing the set of available configurations.

Accumulation is what makes constraint load *load*: individual constraints may be manageable, but their accumulation produces systemic restriction that cannot be addressed one constraint at a time.

## Structural dependencies
- [[constraint]]

## What this is NOT

- Not growth (growth adds capacity; accumulation adds restriction)
- Not aggregation (aggregation sums quantities; accumulation compounds effects)
- Not persistence (persistence is a property of individual differences; accumulation is the stacking of constraints)
- Not entropy (accumulation is about restriction, not disorder)
- Not compounding (compounding implies a rate; accumulation is structural)

## Structural role

Accumulation is the primitive that explains why isolated corrections fail at scale. Without accumulation, constraints would be addressable locally. With accumulation, the system's overall [[admissibility]] shrinks even when individual constraints are resolved. The diagnostic question is: *Are constraints stacking faster than they are being discharged?*
