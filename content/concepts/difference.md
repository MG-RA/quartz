# Difference

## Definition

A **difference** is a detectable distinction under a specified [[transformation-space]]. It is the minimal unit of structure the framework recognizes: something that can be identified as not-the-same relative to a declared set of allowed operations.

Difference is substrate-agnostic. It applies to physical states, data structures, institutional arrangements, or symbolic configurations. What matters is not what the difference *is*, but whether it can be *detected* given a transformation space.

## Structural dependencies
- [[transformation-space]]

## What this is NOT

- Not change (change is temporal; difference is relational)
- Not significance (a difference may be detectable without mattering)
- Not information (information presupposes an observer; difference is structural)
- Not contrast (contrast is perceptual; difference is operational)
- Not distance (distance measures magnitude; difference is binary detection)

## Structural role

Difference is the foundational primitive. Without it, [[persistence]], [[erasure-cost]], and all downstream concepts are undefined. The diagnostic question begins here: *Is there a detectable distinction?* Only then can persistence, cost, and constraint be assessed.
