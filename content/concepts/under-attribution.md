# Under-attribution

## Definition

**Under-attribution** is the failure to assign responsibility to roles that controlled the relevant [[degrees-of-freedom]] within a [[control-surface]]. It occurs when a [[responsibility-claim]] is absent for effects produced by roles that had the capacity to vary the outcome.

The typical symptom: "the system did it" while governance roles that shaped the constraint landscape remain unattributed. Under-attribution renders effects structurally orphaned — they persist, but responsibility is nowhere legible.

Under-attribution and [[over-attribution]] often co-occur: responsibility displaced from its structural home (under-attribution at the governance layer) lands on visible actors who lacked the relevant degrees of freedom (over-attribution at the individual layer).

## Structural dependencies

- [[responsibility-claim]]
- [[control-surface]]

## What this is NOT

- Not amnesty (under-attribution is a structural gap, not a deliberate exemption)
- Not complexity (saying "it's complicated" is not the same as diagnosing where responsibility claims are missing)
- Not diffusion of responsibility (diffusion spreads responsibility thinly; under-attribution is the absence of responsibility claims where control existed)

## Structural role

Under-attribution is a failure state detectable by identifying control surfaces where responsibility claims are absent. Where a role controlled relevant degrees of freedom but no responsibility claim binds that role to the effect, under-attribution has occurred. The diagnostic output identifies the gap, not the remedy.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[saturation]] as a failure state: saturation names when a system has exhausted its options without visible alarm; under-attribution names when responsibility has been exhausted from legible surfaces without visible accounting.
