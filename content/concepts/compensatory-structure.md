# Compensatory Structure

## Definition

**Compensatory structure** is any new structure an agent must build to route around a [[constraint]] rather than satisfying it directly. It is the constructive cost of evasion: not mere disagreement, but observable work whose presence or absence can be audited.

Compensatory structure is the visible form of [[erasure-cost]] applied to constraint avoidance. Where a constraint is bypassed, compensatory structure is what must appear elsewhere to maintain coherence — new interfaces, workarounds, alternative justifications, or replacement coordination mechanisms.

If no compensatory structure appears when a constraint is bypassed, either the constraint was not binding in the relevant context, or the cost has been [[displacement|displaced]] beyond the current audit boundary.

## Structural dependencies
- [[constraint]]
- [[erasure-cost]]

## What this is NOT

- Not disagreement (disagreement is costless; compensatory structure is constructive work)
- Not a workaround (workarounds may or may not produce persistent structure; compensatory structure is specifically the persistent remainder)
- Not damage (compensatory structure is functional — it restores coherence, but at a cost that would not exist if the original constraint had been satisfied)
- Not [[displacement]] (displacement relocates cost; compensatory structure is the cost itself, materialized as observable structure)

## Structural role

Compensatory structure is the **operational test for ineluctability**: a concept is ineluctable within a [[lens]] if and only if bypassing it requires compensatory structure that is more expensive than direct engagement.

This makes ineluctability auditable. The diagnostic question is not "do you agree with this concept?" but "what did you have to build to avoid it, and is that structure visible?"

## Relation to Accounting

Compensatory structure is what [[accounting-failure]] renders invisible. When the cost of routing around a constraint is untracked, the constraint appears optional — not because it was non-binding, but because the compensatory structure was [[displacement|displaced]] or misattributed.

## Relation to Degrees of Freedom

Each degree of freedom closed by formalization, implementation, diagnostics, or [[witness|witnesses]] raises the cost of compensatory structure required for evasion. The ineluctable regime is reached when all remaining evasion paths require compensatory structure that exceeds the cost of engagement.
