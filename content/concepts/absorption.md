# Absorption

## Definition

**Absorption** is the capacity of a system to bear erasure costs locally, without displacing them to other actors, subsystems, or future states. When absorption occurs, the cost of a persistent difference is paid where the difference arises, preventing propagation through the wider system.

Absorption is the structural opposite of displacement. Systems with sufficient absorption capacity can produce persistent differences without generating accounting failure, because erasure costs are both tracked and borne at their point of origin.

## Structural dependencies
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[displacement]]
- [[persistent-difference]]

## What this is NOT

- Not tolerance (tolerance endures effects without cost; absorption pays the cost)
- Not resilience (resilience recovers from shocks; absorption internalizes ongoing burdens)
- Not acceptance (acceptance is attitudinal; absorption is structural capacity)
- Not suppression (suppression hides effects; absorption confronts and pays for them)

## Structural role

Absorption constrains what _responsibility_ can mean at a system level. Where absorption capacity is insufficient, displacement is unavoidable. The diagnostic question is whether the system has the **structural capacity to pay for the persistent differences it produces**, or whether costs must be exported elsewhere.
