# Admissibility

## Definition

**Admissibility** is a structural selector that determines whether a transition, explanation, or action is allowed once [[constraint|constraints]] are respected. It answers the question: *Given the current constraint load, is this path still available?*

Admissibility operates at the interface between structure and action. It does not rank options by desirability or predict which will be chosen. It identifies which options remain structurally coherent—and which have been foreclosed by accumulated constraints.

## Structural dependencies
- [[constraint]]
- [[constraint-load]]

## What this is NOT

- Not possibility (possibility ignores constraints; admissibility respects them)
- Not desirability (desirability ranks by value; admissibility is structural)
- Not optimality (optimality seeks the best; admissibility identifies the available)
- Not legality (legality is rule-based; admissibility is constraint-based)
- Not feasibility (feasibility concerns capacity; admissibility concerns structural allowance)

## Structural role

Admissibility is the selector that lenses enforce. A [[lens]] does not directly constrain the world; it filters interpretations, narratives, and proposed transitions by whether they respect the admissibility rules derived from underlying structure.

When [[constraint-load]] increases, admissibility shrinks. When [[collapse-surface|collapse surfaces]] are approached, entire regions of admissibility disappear. The diagnostic question is: *What remains admissible here, and what has been foreclosed?*
