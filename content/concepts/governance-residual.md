# Governance Residual

## Definition

**Governance residual** is unaccounted authority that persists after rule changes, role transitions, or governance restructuring. When [[constraint-surface|constraint surfaces]] are modified — rules rewritten, enforcement mechanisms changed, governance roles reassigned — the authority exercised under the prior regime does not automatically resolve. Effects produced under prior exemptions, interpretive precedents set by prior authorities, and enforcement asymmetries baked into tooling can persist as governance residuals.

Governance residuals accumulate wherever authority was exercised but not ledgered. They are the governance analogue of [[exemption|exemptions]] that outlive their structural basis: authority that was once active but is now neither visible nor accountable.

## Structural dependencies

- [[exemption]]

## What this is NOT

- Not legacy code (legacy code is visible and modifiable; governance residuals are invisible authority artifacts)
- Not institutional memory (memory is about knowledge; governance residuals are about unresolved authority effects)
- Not precedent (precedent is explicitly recognized; governance residuals persist without recognition)

## Structural role

Governance residual constrains claims of "clean reform." Where governance structures change but prior authority effects are not explicitly resolved, governance residuals persist and may distort current enforcement. The diagnostic task is to identify where authority was exercised under prior constraint surfaces that no longer exist.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[residual]] but for authority artifacts rather than persistent state differences: residuals in irreversibility are state remainders; governance residuals are authority remainders.
