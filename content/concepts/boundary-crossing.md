# Boundary Crossing

## Definition

A **boundary crossing** is a transition between scopes or domains in which some
distinctions may not survive. It marks a location where irreversible effects can
occur unless boundary loss is explicitly accounted.

Boundary crossing is structural. It does not assert that crossing a boundary is
good or bad.

## Structural dependencies

- [[scope]]
- [[irreversibility]]
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[displacement]]
- [[transformation-space]]

## Boundary loss

**Boundary loss** names the distinctions that may be erased by a boundary crossing.
In the admissibility compiler, boundary loss is modeled as an explicit accounting
surface (an erasure-like object) so that permissions, routing, and witnesses can
attach to it deterministically.

## What this is NOT

- Not a global "world boundary".
- Not a claim that crossing is harmful or beneficial.
- Not an ontology of domains; it is a gate in the admissibility lens.
