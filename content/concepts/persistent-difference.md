# Persistent Difference

## Definition

A **persistent difference** is a pattern that remains re-identifiable across a specified [[transformation-space|transformation space]]. Its defining feature is not duration but **resistance to elimination**: removing the [[difference]] requires non-trivial [[erasure-cost|erasure effort]] that cannot be resolved locally or costlessly.

Persistence is not a metaphysical property of the world but a **practical condition of systems**, detected operationally by examining what removal would require. In practice, persistence is revealed when attempts at correction, [[rollback]], or reversal export [[erasure-cost|erasure cost]] across time, agents, or coordination boundaries.

A difference may persist briefly or indefinitely; what matters is whether its removal incurs **non-local or non-negligible cost**, not how long it lasts.

## Structural dependencies
- [[persistence]]
- [[erasure-cost]]

## What this is NOT

- Not permanence (persistence is always relative to a [[transformation-space|transformation space]])
- Not significance (a difference may persist without mattering)
- Not harm (persistence is structural, not evaluative)
- Not memory (memory is one possible mechanism; persistence is substrate-agnostic)
- Not irreversibility itself (persistence is a condition; irreversibility describes cost asymmetry over transitions)

## Structural role

Persistent difference fixes what counts as _undone_ versus merely _obscured_. Once a difference is persistent, claims of correction, rollback, or reversal are incomplete unless they specify **where the erasure cost landed**. Without this concept, systems can repeatedly declare success while silently accumulating constraints.
