# Tracking Mechanism

Layer: accounting

## Definition

A **tracking mechanism** is a system component that records persistent differences and maintains correspondence between those differences and their associated erasure costs. Tracking mechanisms make accounting possible by ensuring that effects produced remain linked to obligations incurred.

Tracking does not itself absorb erasure costs, nor does it prevent displacement. Instead, it renders both absorption and displacement **visible and assignable**. In the absence of tracking mechanisms, persistent differences accumulate invisibly and costs propagate without attribution.

## What this is NOT

- Not monitoring (monitoring observes behavior; tracking records obligations)
- Not logging (logging records events; tracking maintains ongoing accounts)
- Not measurement (measurement quantifies states; tracking assigns responsibility)
- Not memory (memory retains information; tracking links production to cost)

## Structural role

Tracking mechanisms name what accounting failure lacks. Without them, a system cannot distinguish between differences that have been resolved and differences whose costs have merely moved elsewhere. The diagnostic question is whether the system **knows what it has produced and where the associated erasure costs currently reside**.
