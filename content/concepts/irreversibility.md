# Irreversibility

Tags: #concept

## Definition

**Irreversibility** is a composed structural property: [[persistence]] combined with [[erasure-cost]] [[asymmetry]]. A transition is irreversible when its effects persist and cannot be undone at comparable cost to their production.

Irreversibility is not an ontological claim about time or causation. It is a **structural condition** detected operationally: if reversal requires significantly more resources than the original action, the transition is irreversible relative to the specified [[transformation-space]].

## Structural dependencies
- [[persistence]]
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[asymmetry]]
- [[transformation-space]]

## What this is NOT

- Not permanence (irreversibility is always relative to a transformation space and cost threshold)
- Not entropy (compatible with thermodynamic irreversibility but not identical)
- Not fatalism (irreversibility does not imply inevitability)
- Not harm (irreversibility is structural, not evaluative)
- Not a primitive (it is composed from persistence + asymmetry)

## Structural role

Irreversibility is the first-order composite that grounds the diagnostic lens. It explains why [[displacement]], [[constraint-accumulation]], and [[accounting-failure]] matter: in irreversible systems, costs that are not absorbed accumulate. The diagnostic question is: *Can this transition be undone at comparable cost?* If not, irreversibility accounting applies.

## Composition

Irreversibility = [[persistence]] + [[erasure-cost]] + [[asymmetry]]

This composition is explicit. Irreversibility is not primitive but derived.
