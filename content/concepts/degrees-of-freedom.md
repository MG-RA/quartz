# Degrees of Freedom

## Definition

**Degrees of freedom** names the set of transitions that were actually available to a role at the time of action, within its declared [[control-surface]] and at its declared [[agency-layer]]. It is the operational test for meaningful attribution: if a role had no degrees of freedom with respect to an outcome, attributing responsibility for that outcome is structurally empty.

Degrees of freedom are not hypothetical. They are constrained by the feasible set available to the role at the time. Retrospective claims that "they could have done otherwise" are valid only if the degrees of freedom included that alternative within the declared scope.

## Structural dependencies

- [[agency-layer]]
- [[control-surface]]

## What this is NOT

- Not infinite options (degrees of freedom are always finite and constrained)
- Not hindsight (must be evaluated relative to the feasible set at the time of action, not retrospectively)
- Not competence (a role may have degrees of freedom it lacks the skill to exercise; the concept names structural availability, not performance)
- Not permission (degrees of freedom include what the role *could* vary, whether or not it was authorized to)

## Structural role

Degrees of freedom is the operational test for attribution claims, analogous to how [[erasure-cost]] operationally tests [[persistence]]. If a claimed responsibility exceeds the degrees of freedom available to the attributed role, the claim is structurally invalid. This prevents attribution of effects to roles that could not have produced different outcomes within their control surface.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[erasure-cost]] as an operational test: erasure-cost tests whether a difference is truly persistent, degrees-of-freedom tests whether a responsibility claim is truly meaningful.
- Analogous to [[feasible-set]] but indexed to a specific role rather than a system state.
