# Collapse Surface

## Definition

A **collapse surface** is a boundary in configuration space at which accumulated persistence and [[residual|residuals]] remove certain states from the [[feasible-set|feasible set]] or raise their erasure cost beyond practicable bounds. It is not a point but a surface: a structural region beyond which the system cannot return to previously available configurations without **discontinuous intervention**, such as large-scale re-coordination, redesign, or external shock.

Collapse surfaces are typically **approached gradually** through constraint accumulation. If crossed, the loss of options is experienced **abruptly**, even though the conditions producing it developed incrementally.

## Structural dependencies
- [[feasible-set]]
- [[constraint-accumulation]]
- [[persistence]]
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[residual]]

## What this is NOT

- Not failure (systems may cross collapse surfaces and continue operating, but with permanently reduced option sets)
- Not crisis (crisis is an event; collapse surface is a structural boundary)
- Not limit (limits can sometimes be extended by paying cost; collapse surfaces mark where additional cost no longer restores options)
- Not tipping point (tipping points describe runaway dynamics; collapse surfaces describe geometric loss of admissible states)

## Structural role

Collapse surfaces constrain optimism about future flexibility. Where such surfaces exist, accumulated persistence can foreclose entire regions of configuration space. The diagnostic questions are: **which options are being eliminated**, whether this foreclosure is visible in advance, and **which apparently stabilizing actions are in fact accelerating approach to the boundary**.
