# Transformation Space

## Definition

**Transformation space** is the set of allowed operations under which the re-identification of a pattern is evaluated. Persistence is not absolute; it is always **relative to a specified transformation space**. A pattern may persist under one set of permitted transformations and dissolve under another, depending on what changes are considered admissible.

Transformation space is a **chosen analytic scope**, not a discovered property of the world.

> [!note]
> Interpretation constraint: Transformation space is chosen, not discovered.

By making this choice explicit, the diagnostic can be applied across physical, computational, institutional, and symbolic domains without relying on substrate-specific definitions.

## Structural dependencies
None (axiomatic). Transformation space is the scope boundary that makes all other concepts auditable.

## Grounds

- [[difference]] — detectability is relative to transformation space
- [[persistence]] — re-identification requires a declared transformation space
- [[persistent-difference]] — persistence claims are only auditable given a transformation space

## What this is NOT

- Not state space (state space describes possible configurations; transformation space specifies the allowed operations between them)
- Not possibility space (possibility includes unreachable states; transformation space restricts what transitions are permitted)
- Not context (context is situational and contingent; transformation space is structural and declared)
- Not frame of reference (frames of reference are observational; transformation spaces are operational)
- Not ontology (it does not assert what is real, only what transformations count)

## Structural role

Transformation space constrains what _same_ and _different_ can mean. Any claim about persistence implicitly assumes a transformation space; making it explicit renders such claims **auditable and comparable**. Apparent disagreement about persistence often reflects divergent transformation spaces rather than substantive disagreement about the system itself.
