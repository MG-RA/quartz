# Propagation

## Definition

The spread of effects beyond their point of origin. Propagation is what transforms local actions into persistent differences with distributed consequences. When effects propagate, they couple to external systems, inform subsequent action, or create records that outlast the original event. Propagation is the mechanism by which small-scale reversibility fails to guarantee large-scale reversibility.

## Structural dependencies
- [[persistent-difference]]

## What this is NOT

- Not transmission (transmission implies a sender and receiver; propagation can be undirected)
- Not amplification (amplification increases magnitude; propagation increases reach)
- Not contagion (contagion implies copying; propagation includes structural coupling)
- Not influence (influence is agentive; propagation can be purely mechanical)

## Structural role

Constrains when local analysis suffices. If propagation is occurring, then effects at origin do not bound effects elsewhere. Identifies the question: where has this gone, and what has it coupled to?
