# Self-diagnosability

## Definition

**Self-diagnosability** is a system's capacity to examine its own [[constraint-surface|constraint surfaces]] using the same machinery it applies to other participants. A system is self-diagnosable when its governance mechanisms can detect violations in the governance mechanisms themselves — when the diagnostic apparatus is not exempt from diagnosis.

Self-diagnosability is the operational payoff of [[constraint-reflexivity]]. Where reflexivity is a property of individual constraint surfaces, self-diagnosability is a property of the system as a whole: can the system, using its existing tools, identify where its own governance is failing?

The operational test: if a constraint surface develops an [[exemption-path]], can the system detect that exemption path without requiring external intervention? If yes, the system is self-diagnosable at that point. If detection requires "looking from outside" or social/political pressure, self-diagnosability has failed there.

## Structural dependencies

- [[constraint-reflexivity]]
- [[enforcement-topology]]

## What this is NOT

- Not self-awareness (self-diagnosability is about mechanical inspection capacity, not consciousness or reflection)
- Not completeness (a system may be self-diagnosable for some constraint surfaces and not others)
- Not infallibility (self-diagnosability means violations can be detected, not that they will always be caught)
- Not self-correction (detection is separate from repair; self-diagnosability is about the former)

## Structural role

Self-diagnosability is the accounting measure for governance health. It determines whether governance failures can be detected mechanically or require external intervention. Systems that lose self-diagnosability require escalating external pressure (social, political, or structural) to correct governance failures — which is precisely the condition the [[Governance]] invariant exists to prevent.
