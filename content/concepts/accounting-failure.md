# Accounting Failure

## Definition

**Accounting failure** is a structural condition in which a system produces persistent differences without effective mechanisms to track, assign, or absorb the associated erasure costs. In such systems, [[residual|residuals]] accumulate, erasure costs are displaced across actors, subsystems, or time, and responsibility for those costs becomes diffused, contested, or unassigned.

Under accounting failure, corrective actions may occur repeatedly, but they do not reduce underlying constraint load. Apparent improvement reflects local adjustment rather than resolution of accumulated persistence.

## Structural dependencies
- [[persistent-difference]]
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[tracking-mechanism]]
- [[absorption]]
- [[displacement]]
- [[constraint-load]]
- [[residual]]

## What this is NOT

- Not negligence (accounting failure can occur despite competence, care, or oversight)
- Not error (errors are discrete and local; accounting failure is structural and cumulative)
- Not fraud (fraud involves intentional concealment; accounting failure often persists without awareness)
- Not insolvency (insolvency is recognized and priced; accounting failure operates unrecognized)

## Structural role

Accounting failure names the failure mode the diagnostic lens detects. When present, a system's self-reports of correction, progress, or improvement are unreliable indicators of actual constraint load. The diagnostic question is whether the system **knows what persistent differences it has produced and what is owed as a result**.
