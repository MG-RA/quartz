# Boundary

## Definition

A **boundary** is a declared separation between scopes/domains that classifies effects as “inside” vs “outside” (what counts as in-scope).

A [[boundary-crossing]] is the transition across that separation; crossings are presumptively irreversible and therefore require explicit admissibility and accounting.

A boundary can exist without enforcement; operators like [[containment]] are what impose routing, gating, and ongoing boundary work.

## Structural dependencies
- [[difference]]
- [[persistence]]
- [[irreversibility]]
- [[admissibility]]

## What this is NOT

- Not a physical border (it can be logical, social, procedural, or representational)
- Not a guarantee of separation (boundaries can leak; they are claims that require witnesses)
- Not automatically reversible (crossings are treated as presumptively irreversible until shown otherwise)

## Structural role

Boundaries are where scope is declared and where irreversibility tends to enter: the system either carries witnesses across the boundary (attestation), or it accumulates untracked loss (accounting failure).
