# Asymmetry

Tags: #concept

Layer: primitive

## Definition

**Asymmetry** is the structural fact that creation and erasure of differences have unequal costs. Producing a [[difference]] typically requires localized, bounded action. Eliminating that difference—once it [[persistence|persists]]—often requires broader effort, coordination, or expenditure that exceeds the original production cost.

This asymmetry is observable across substrates: thermodynamic, computational, institutional, ecological. It is not a contingent feature of particular systems but a recurring structural pattern.

## Structural dependencies
- [[difference]]
- [[persistence]]

## What this is NOT

- Not injustice (asymmetry is structural, not moral)
- Not inefficiency (the asymmetry may be unavoidable or even useful)
- Not entropy (compatible with thermodynamic irreversibility but not reducible to it)
- Not inequality (inequality concerns distribution of goods; asymmetry concerns cost differentials)
- Not imbalance (imbalance suggests correction is needed; asymmetry is descriptive)

## Structural role

Asymmetry explains why "we can fix it later" often fails. It is the primitive that, combined with [[persistence]], generates [[irreversibility]]. Without asymmetry, all persistent differences would be equally easy to create and remove, and correction narratives would be structurally coherent. With asymmetry, they are not.
