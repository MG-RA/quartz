# Constraint Accumulation

## Definition

**Constraint accumulation** is the cumulative growth of constraint load arising from persistent differences that are not effectively tracked or absorbed. As such differences are produced and maintained, the incompatibilities they introduce compound, progressively narrowing the set of configurations the system can occupy without additional erasure cost.

This process is often invisible at the point of action. Its presence is typically inferred only when effects emerge as **brittleness** or **saturation**, at which point corrective actions tend to address surface symptoms while leaving the underlying constraint load unchanged or further increased.

## What this is NOT

- Not growth (growth adds capacity; accumulation adds restriction)
- Not learning (learning can reduce future constraint load even as it adds structure)
- Not aging (aging is temporal; accumulation is structural and may be rapid or discontinuous)
- Not entropy increase (compatible with but not identical to thermodynamic entropy)
- Not inevitability (accumulation depends on accounting and absorption, not time alone)

## Structural role

Constraint accumulation constrains claims of _sustainable iteration_. Where it is present, repeated "improvements" may preserve local performance while systematically reducing global flexibility. The diagnostic question is whether successive actions are **opening admissible futures**, or merely **maintaining function by closing off alternatives elsewhere**.
