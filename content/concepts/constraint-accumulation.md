# Constraint Accumulation

## Definition

**Constraint accumulation** is the cumulative growth of [[constraint-load|constraint load]] arising from [[persistent-difference|persistent differences]] and [[residual|residuals]] that are not effectively tracked or absorbed. As such [[difference|differences]] are produced and maintained, the incompatibilities they introduce compound, progressively narrowing the set of configurations the system can occupy without additional [[erasure-cost|erasure cost]].

This process is often invisible at the point of action. Its presence is typically inferred only when effects emerge as [[brittleness]] or [[saturation]], at which point corrective actions tend to address surface symptoms while leaving the underlying [[constraint-load|constraint load]] unchanged or further increased.

## Structural dependencies
- [[accumulation]]
- [[constraint]]
- [[constraint-load]]
- [[difference]]
- [[persistent-difference]]
- [[residual]]

## What this is NOT

- Not growth (growth adds capacity; accumulation adds restriction)
- Not learning (learning can reduce future constraint load even as it adds structure)
- Not aging (aging is temporal; accumulation is structural and may be rapid or discontinuous)
- Not entropy increase (compatible with but not identical to thermodynamic entropy)
- Not inevitability (accumulation depends on accounting and absorption, not time alone)

## Structural role

Constraint accumulation constrains claims of _sustainable iteration_. Where it is present, repeated "improvements" may preserve local performance while systematically reducing global flexibility. The diagnostic question is whether successive actions are **opening [[admissibility|admissible]] futures**, or merely **maintaining function by closing off alternatives elsewhere**.
