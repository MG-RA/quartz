# Attribution Residual

## Definition

**Attribution residual** is a responsibility artifact that persists after the role, context, or organizational structure that produced it has changed. When roles are reassigned, teams restructured, or governance surfaces modified, existing responsibility claims do not automatically update. The gap between prior attribution and current control creates attribution residuals.

Attribution residuals accumulate wherever responsibility claims outlive the control surfaces they were indexed to. A common symptom: someone is "still responsible" for an effect produced under a control surface that no longer exists or that they no longer occupy.

## Structural dependencies

- [[responsibility-claim]]

## What this is NOT

- Not guilt (attribution residuals are structural artifacts, not moral states)
- Not institutional memory (memory is about knowledge; attribution residuals are about unresolved responsibility bindings)
- Not debt (debt implies an obligation; attribution residuals are descriptive of a structural gap, not prescriptive of repayment)

## Structural role

Attribution residual constrains claims of "clean transition." Where roles change but responsibility claims are not explicitly re-evaluated, attribution residuals persist and may distort future attribution. The diagnostic task is to identify where responsibility claims are indexed to defunct control surfaces.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[residual]] but for responsibility artifacts rather than persistent state differences: residuals in irreversibility are state remainders that constrain options; attribution residuals are responsibility bindings that outlive their structural basis.
