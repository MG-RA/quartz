# Lens

## Definition

A **lens** is a constrained transformation layer that maps high-dimensional inputs
into a restricted space of admissible distinctions by enforcing structural rules
about what differences count, persist, or are discarded.

A lens does not add content, values, or goals.
It restricts interpretation by eliminating incoherent transformations.

## Structural dependencies
- [[admissibility]]
- [[difference]]
- [[persistence]]

## What this is NOT

- Not a worldview or belief system
- Not a theory of meaning or truth
- Not a generator of explanations
- Not a prescription or decision rule
- Not merely a metaphor

A lens does not decide outcomes.
It determines which explanations, actions, or interpretations are *structurally admissible*.

## Structural role

A lens functions as a **compiler-like constraint layer**:

- Inputs: observations, events, descriptions
- Rules: admissible distinctions, forbidden inferences, resolution limits
- Outputs: reduced representations suitable for diagnosis or action

Lenses:
- discard degrees of freedom
- amplify selected differences
- impose resolution limits
- exhibit characteristic failure modes
- require calibration and maintenance

Lenses are substrate-agnostic.
They may operate over physical, biological, informational, institutional,
or economic substrates.

## Failure modes (non-exhaustive)

- Drift: gradual relaxation of constraints
- Overfitting: rejecting valid distinctions
- Self-sealing: explaining away critique
- Saturation: loss of discriminative power
- Misalignment: constraints target the wrong downstream layer
