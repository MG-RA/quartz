# Erasure Asymmetry

Tags: #concept

Layer: primitive

## Definition

The observed imbalance between the ease of producing a persistent difference and the cost of undoing it. Creating an effect often requires limited, localized action, while undoing that effect requires broader effort, coordination, or expenditure. This asymmetry is observable in practice without reference to underlying intentions or values.

## What this is NOT

- Not injustice (asymmetry is structural, not moral)
- Not inefficiency (the asymmetry may be unavoidable)
- Not thermodynamic irreversibility specifically (though compatible with it)
- Not a bug (some asymmetries are features of how systems work)

## Structural role

Constrains correction narratives. If erasure asymmetry holds, then "we can fix it later" carries hidden costs. Any framework that assumes symmetric reversibility must account for this asymmetry or lose explanatory power at scale.
