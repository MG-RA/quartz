# Persistence Gradient

## Definition

The variation in irreversibility across actors, subsystems, or time horizons. The same effect may be trivially reversible for one actor and permanently binding for another. Persistence gradients reveal that "irreversible" is not a binary property but a relational one—dependent on who is asking, at what scale, and over what duration. An effect that is reversible for the producer may be irreversible for the recipient.

## Structural dependencies
- [[irreversibility]]

## What this is NOT

- Not severity (severity measures impact; gradient measures differential reversibility)
- Not inequality (inequality concerns distribution of goods; gradient concerns distribution of constraint)
- Not time decay (decay implies uniform fading; gradient implies differential persistence)
- Not scope (scope is about reach; gradient is about asymmetric reversibility)

## Structural role

Constrains claims of "reversible for everyone." If persistence gradients exist, then system-level reversibility claims must specify for whom. Identifies the question: who experiences this as permanent that the producer experiences as temporary?
