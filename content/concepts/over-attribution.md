# Over-attribution

## Definition

**Over-attribution** is the assignment of responsibility to roles that did not control the relevant [[degrees-of-freedom]]. It occurs when a [[responsibility-claim]] binds a role to an effect that falls outside that role's [[control-surface]], or when responsibility is attributed at an [[agency-layer]] where the role did not operate.

Over-attribution is not merely inaccurate — it is structurally load-bearing in the wrong direction. It creates the appearance of accountability while obscuring where control actually lived. The typical pattern: blame flows "downward" to visible actors while control lives at the governance or structural layer.

## Structural dependencies

- [[responsibility-claim]]
- [[degrees-of-freedom]]

## What this is NOT

- Not harsh judgment (over-attribution is a structural error, not excessive criticism)
- Not high expectations (expecting more from a role is not over-attribution unless the role lacks the degrees of freedom to meet the expectation)
- Not disagreement about outcomes (over-attribution is about mismatched control, not contested values)

## Structural role

Over-attribution is a failure state detectable by checking whether the attributed role's degrees of freedom include the effect being attributed. Where they do not, the attribution is over-extended. The diagnostic output is descriptive: it identifies where responsibility claims exceed control, not whether punishment or blame is deserved.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[brittleness]] as a failure state: brittleness names when a system has lost the ability to absorb perturbation; over-attribution names when a responsibility structure has lost its connection to control.
