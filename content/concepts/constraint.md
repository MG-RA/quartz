## Definition

A **constraint** is a restriction on the set of transitions a system can undergo. Constraints reduce the configuration space: they eliminate possibilities, narrow options, and foreclose paths that would otherwise be available.

Constraints are not inherently negative. They may be functional (enabling coordination), protective (preventing harm), or structural (reflecting physical law). What matters diagnostically is that they **remove degrees of freedom** from the admissible set.

## What this is NOT

- Not limit (limits bound magnitude; constraints bound transitions)
- Not rule (rules are prescriptive; constraints are structural)
- Not barrier (barriers block specific paths; constraints reshape the entire admissible space)
- Not pressure (pressure motivates action; constraints restrict it)
- Not cost (cost is what removal requires; constraint is the restriction itself)

## Structural role

Constraint is the primitive that converts [[persistence]] into systemic effect. Persistent differences that do not constrain are structurally inert. Those that do constrain reduce [[admissibility]] and contribute to [[constraint-load]]. The diagnostic question is: *What transitions does this difference foreclose?*
