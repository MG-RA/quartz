# Displacement

Layer: first-order

## Definition

**Displacement** is the relocation of erasure costs away from the locus where a persistent difference would otherwise be absorbed, and onto other actors, subsystems, or future states. When a difference is corrected, deferred, ignored, or locally mitigated, the associated erasure cost does not vanish; it is **reassigned across space, time, or organizational boundaries**.

Displacement is the primary mechanism through which accounting failures compound. Costs remain real and operative, but become **unassigned or weakly attributed**, allowing constraint load to accumulate outside the field of local decision-making.

## Structural dependencies
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[persistent-difference]]

## What this is NOT

- Not externalization alone (externalization is typically economic and spatial; displacement also includes temporal and structural relocation)
- Not blame-shifting (displacement can occur without intent, awareness, or strategic behavior)
- Not transfer (transfer implies a recipient who accepts; displacement can land on entities that never consented)
- Not diffusion (diffusion spreads cost thinly; displacement relocates cost, which may remain concentrated or reappear elsewhere)

## Structural role

Displacement constrains claims of _local resolution_. Where displacement occurs, "solved here" implies "borne elsewhere."

> [!note]
> Interpretation constraint: The diagnostic task is not to assign fault.

The diagnostic task is to identify **who or what is now carrying the erasure cost, and how that burden constrains future options in its new location**.
