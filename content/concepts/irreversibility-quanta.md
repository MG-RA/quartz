# Irreversibility Quanta

## Definition

An **irreversibility quantum** is the smallest action-sized difference whose erasure requires exporting cost beyond the local system. It is discrete (not continuous), defined relative to a [[transformation-space]], and detected by [[erasure-asymmetry]] rather than by magnitude or harm.

If undoing an action requires more coordination, authority, time, or structure than performing it, a quantum has been crossed.

## Structural dependencies

- [[transformation-space]]
- [[difference]]
- [[persistence]]
- [[erasure-cost]]
- [[asymmetry]]

## What this is NOT

- Not the smallest physical change (it is action-sized, not substrate-sized)
- Not a unit of energy or entropy
- Not a moral threshold or severity scale
- Not a measure of damage or importance
- Not an optimization target or metric

"Quantum" refers only to structural discreteness: a step after which some futures are no longer reachable without additional cost.

## Structural role

Irreversibility quanta constrain what *local correction* can mean. Once a quantum is crossed, claims that an action was "undone" or "fixed" are structurally incomplete unless they specify where the erasure cost landed. The concept rules out a common implicit move: treating local correction as global erasure.

## Detection criterion

A change constitutes an irreversibility quantum if **at least one** holds:

- Rollback requires a different authority than the original action
- Rollback requires broader coordination than forward execution
- Rollback creates new artifacts rather than removing old ones
- Rollback preserves the trace or precedent even if effects are mitigated
- Rollback displaces cost to other actors, subsystems, or time horizons

The moment rollback ceases to be an inverse and becomes a *new action*, irreversibility has occurred.

## Relation to persistence

Irreversibility quanta are not about whether something persists forever. They mark whether a difference remains re-identifiable under relevant transformations such that its erasure is asymmetric and displaced. Persistence is evaluated relative to a domain's allowed operations, not to absolute time or substrate.

## Relation to agency

Agency is not the freedom to avoid irreversibility. Agency is the capacity to choose where the next quantum of irreversibility lands. Strong agency localizes and contains quanta. Weak agency disperses them while assuming future rollback.

> Misuse risk: Any attempt to operationalize quanta as scores, metrics, or optimization targets collapses the diagnostic into a decision framework and violates its purpose.
