# Attribution Displacement

## Definition

**Attribution displacement** is the routing of responsibility claims away from the [[control-surface]] where control actually operated, and onto roles that did not control the relevant [[degrees-of-freedom]]. When responsibility is displaced, the structural binding between role and effect is broken, but a new (invalid) binding is asserted in its place.

Attribution displacement is the primary mechanism through which [[over-attribution]] and [[under-attribution]] compound. Responsibility claims relocate — typically downward to visible actors or outward to diffuse "system" attributions — while the roles that controlled the relevant constraint surfaces remain unattributed.

## Structural dependencies

- [[responsibility-claim]]
- [[control-surface]]

## What this is NOT

- Not delegation (delegation transfers control with responsibility; displacement relocates responsibility without transferring control)
- Not diffusion (diffusion spreads responsibility thinly; displacement relocates it to specific roles that lack relevant control)
- Not scapegoating (scapegoating implies intent; attribution displacement can occur without awareness or strategy)
- Not cost displacement (cost displacement in irreversibility routes erasure work; attribution displacement routes responsibility claims)

## Structural role

Attribution displacement constrains claims of "local accountability." Where displacement occurs, "responsible here" implies "unaccounted elsewhere." The diagnostic task is to identify where responsibility claims land relative to where control actually operated.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[displacement]] but for responsibility claims rather than erasure costs: displacement in irreversibility routes where removal work lands; attribution displacement routes where responsibility claims land relative to control.
