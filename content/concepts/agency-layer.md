# Agency Layer

## Definition

**Agency layer** is an indexing scheme that distinguishes the type of control being exercised or attributed. A responsibility claim is meaningful only when evaluated at the layer where control actually operated.

The minimal set of layers:

- **Causal layer**: a mechanism produced a difference, independent of intent.
- **Intentional layer**: an actor selected an action among perceived options.
- **Structural / governance layer**: a role shaped the constraint landscape (rules, interfaces, incentives, enforcement).

Agency layers are not ranked. They are coordinates. Cross-layer attribution without explicit translation is structurally invalid.

## Structural dependencies

- [[control-surface]]

## What this is NOT

- Not a hierarchy of importance (no layer is inherently "higher" or "more responsible")
- Not moral weight (layers index control type, not blame magnitude)
- Not a completeness claim (other layers may exist; these three are the minimal working set)
- Not a theory of mind (intentional agency does not require full rationality, only selection among options)

## Structural role

Agency layer constrains where responsibility claims can be evaluated. A claim that mixes layers without declaring the translation is underspecified. Diagnostic operators must declare which layer they are evaluating before producing attribution outputs.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[transformation-space]] as an indexing primitive: transformation-space indexes what counts as change, agency-layer indexes what kind of control is being claimed.
