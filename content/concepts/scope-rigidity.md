# Scope Rigidity

## Definition

**Scope rigidity** is accumulated over-specification within a decomposition: the state where [[role-boundary|role boundaries]] have been drawn so tightly or so prolifically that the system loses the ability to accommodate legitimate variation without violating its own structure. It is the decomposition-specific form of excessive constraint — not general constraint accumulation, but specifically the accumulation of structural separations that prevent productive work.

Scope rigidity typically appears when decomposition is pursued past its productive limit. Every new role distinction, every new boundary, every new purity check adds structural load. Below the refinement ceiling, this load eliminates error classes. Above it, the load constrains legitimate operations without corresponding benefit.

The diagnostic signal: when structural violations consistently arise from legitimate, well-intended work — not from negligence or role confusion — scope rigidity may be present.

## Structural dependencies

- [[role-boundary]]

## What this is NOT

- Not constraint load (constraint load in irreversibility is about accumulated incompatibilities from persistent differences; scope rigidity is about over-specification from excessive decomposition)
- Not strictness (strict enforcement of appropriate boundaries is not rigidity; rigidity is when the boundaries themselves are counterproductive)
- Not resistance to change (scope rigidity is a structural condition, not a cultural one)

## Structural role

Scope rigidity constrains claims that "more decomposition is always better." It names the failure mode where structural discipline becomes structural obstruction. The diagnostic checks whether decomposition violations correlate with legitimate work rather than role confusion, which would indicate that role boundaries need adjustment rather than additional enforcement.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[constraint-load]] but for decomposition structure rather than persistent differences: constraint-load tracks accumulated incompatibilities from change; scope-rigidity tracks accumulated rigidity from over-specification.
