# Layer Collapse

## Definition

**Layer collapse** is the conflation of distinct [[agency-layer|agency layers]] within a single [[responsibility-claim]]. It occurs when causal, intentional, and structural/governance responsibility are treated as interchangeable, producing attribution claims that are structurally ambiguous.

Common forms:

- Treating structural failures as moral failures (governance layer collapsed into intentional layer).
- Treating intent as sufficient explanation for systemic outcomes (intentional layer collapsed into structural layer).
- Treating mechanism output as intentional action (causal layer collapsed into intentional layer).

Layer collapse is not imprecision — it is a specific structural error that makes attribution claims unevaluable, because the layer at which the claim should be assessed is undefined.

## Structural dependencies

- [[agency-layer]]
- [[responsibility-claim]]

## What this is NOT

- Not simplification (simplification reduces detail; layer collapse removes the indexing dimension entirely)
- Not interdependence (layers can interact without collapsing; collapse means the distinction is no longer maintained)
- Not reductionism (reductionism claims one layer is fundamental; layer collapse treats them as identical)

## Structural role

Layer collapse is a failure state detectable by checking whether a responsibility claim specifies a single, consistent agency layer. Claims that attribute effects across layers without declaring the translation are exhibiting layer collapse. The diagnostic output identifies which layers have been conflated, not whether the conflation is morally or politically motivated.

## Parallels

- Analogous to [[collapse-surface]] but for attribution rather than option space: collapse-surface names where options disappear discontinuously; layer-collapse names where agency distinctions disappear, making attribution structurally indeterminate.
