## Definition

**Erasure cost** is the set of resources required to remove a persistent difference, or to reduce it such that it no longer constrains future options. These resources may take multiple forms, including time, energy, attention, coordination, or the acceptance of new constraints elsewhere.

Erasure cost functions as the **operational test for persistence**: if a difference can be removed locally, immediately, and without non-trivial expenditure, then it was not persistent in the relevant transformation space. Where removal appears cheap, scrutiny must focus on whether costs were hidden, deferred, or exported beyond the local frame.

Paying erasure cost does not guarantee net reduction of burden; in practice, removal often redistributes cost across time, agents, or systems rather than eliminating it outright.

## Structural dependencies
- [[persistence]]

## What this is NOT

- Not punishment or penalty (it is structural, not normative)
- Not effort (effort can be expended without effect; erasure cost is what removal actually requires)
- Not price (prices are assigned; erasure cost exists whether tracked or not)
- Not entropy (erasure cost applies to social and institutional systems and is not reducible to thermodynamic measures)
- Not delay (postponement is not erasure)

## Structural role

Erasure cost constrains what claims of _reversal_ can mean. Any assertion that a difference has been undone must specify **what resources were expended and where their burden landed**. If no such account exists, either the difference was not persistent in the first place, or the erasure cost was displaced, deferred, or rendered invisible.
